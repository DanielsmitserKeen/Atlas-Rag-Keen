by Vivian Guo, Iconiq Capital

### [The Top Metrics for Vertical SaaS Companies](https://www.mostlymetrics.com/p/the-top-metrics-for-vertical-saas)

by CJ Gustafson, Mostly Metrics

> You can’t be everything to everyone. I’ve tried – just ask my in laws.
> 
> In all seriousness though, that’s kinda what Horizontal SaaS promises (or tries) to be. You can think of Horizontal SaaS as broad-based tech that is industry agnostic; a sales person at a Cybersecurity company can use HubSpot the same way a sales person at a Health Supplements company might use it. It literally tries to make all industries happy.

by Mikael Johnsson, SaaS Nordic

> While not necessarily completely useless, I would strongly argue that R40 is a metric applicable to the world of PE and public markets investing and is not a good metric for assessing the quality of venture-stage companies.

### [No Wait, of Course That Is the Single Most Important SaaS Metric](https://blog.asmartbear.com/important-saas-metric.html)

by Jason Cohen, A Smart Bear

> The purpose of a metric is to be a tool in service of your goals, timeline, size, circumstance, even philosophy, not as a master you are thoughtlessly obligated to obey.

by Christoph Janz, Point Nine Capital

> …everyone is now aware of cohort analyses, and every major web, product, or revenue analytics product offers features for cohort analysis, it still requires time to fully comprehend everything you need to know about cohort analyses and, perhaps more importantly, to utilize them to obtain real, actionable insights.

### [How CFOs Think About Software Spend](https://www.mostlymetrics.com/p/how-cfos-think-about-software-spend)

by CJ Gustafson, Mostly Metrics

> What I can attest to is that there’s a business case behind why we need each tool, supported by an executive who is directly accountable for results. We trust leaders to make decisions on what tools they need to get the most out of their teams.

### [Guide to SaaS Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue in SaaS](https://www.thesaascfo.com/deferred-revenue-saas/?utm_source=SaaS+Roundup+by+ChartMogul&utm_campaign=826a10955d-SaaS_Roundup_340&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_985dd3c6ea-826a10955d-)

by Ben Murray, The SaaS CFO

> SaaS revenue recognition is an ongoing priority for SaaS accounting teams. Software subscriptions are the life of every SaaS business and must be accounted for properly in your general ledger.
> 
> However, most SaaS companies I have spoken with are incorrectly recording their most important revenue stream. That is SaaS subscription revenue and the corresponding deferred revenue balance.

> 
> Seasoned chief financial officers (CFOs) help a business ramp toward IPO, optimize treasury management, and even navigate major external crises, as we’ve seen with recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. But it’s not always clear when and how to find the right finance leader.

by Bill Binch, Battery Ventures

> As a revenue leader at large and small technology companies, I’ve spent the last 15 years of my career attending a LOT of quarterly board meetings. These meetings—once-a-quarter events that take countless hours to prepare for—can create a lot of stress. 
> 
> The prep and the practice can be draining and, more importantly, distracting from your daily grind. This is all necessary because the board meeting is such a high-stakes event. As a wise mentor once told me, no one ever gets a promotion from a board meeting—but people sure do get fired afterwards.

by Dave Kellogg

> Finance types on the board might view these as simple canapes served before the meal.  I view them as critical strategic context.

by Nandu Anilal

In parallel this post delves into different forms of moats as well as competition more generally.

by Emily Kramer, MKT1

> Startups waste way too much money hiring contractors for all the wrong things, mismanaging agencies, placing blame on agencies when the issue is the startup’s own strategy, and leaving contractors to fend for themselves. I’ve even seen an early-stage startup use an agency to manage contractors, who then managed more contractors—it sounds confusing because it is confusing.

### [It’s time to retire the LTV metric](https://mobiledevmemo.com/retire-the-lifetime-customer-value-metric/)

by Eric Benjamin Seufert

> But the LTV metric is an anachronism on mobile. For one, no one thinks about monetization on the basis of some abstract “lifetime”: in this second act of the mobile economy, users are sticky, products are enduring, and monetization streams are complex.
> 
> The “LTV paradigm” really represents the first act of the mobile economy, when products could launch and gain traction with relatively modest budgets and users casually, frictionlessly flitted between them as fungible commodities.

### [The Dangerous Seduction of the Lifetime Value (LTV) Formula](https://abovethecrowd.com/2012/09/04/the-dangerous-seduction-of-the-lifetime-value-ltv-formula/)

by Bill Gurley

> The LTV formula, when used correctly, can be a good tactical tool for monitoring and comparing like-minded variable market programs, especially across channels.
> 
> But like any model, its proper use is entirely dependent on the assumptions used in that model. Also, people who have a hidden agenda or who confuse a model with reality can misuse it. For many companies that subscribe to its wisdom, the formula slowly takes on more importance than it should.

> *   How do you enable users to try and buy via self-service rather than through a rep?
> *   Which experiments should you run to improve product activation and conversion?

by Matt Lerner

> What’s going on here isn’t magic, nor is it “just marketing tactics.” It’s language/market fit at work — when you find the exact right words to explain your product or service to prospective customers, words that resonate with goals and struggles that are already in their brains.

> When you talk about your product, a lightbulb in their heads switches on that says, “That is EXACTLY what I’m looking for” — they feel like you’ve read their minds.
