## GTM Fundamentals

### What is Go-to-Market Strategy?

GTM strategy defines how you acquire customers & generate revenue :

**Core components**:

*   **Target customer** : Who are you selling to? (ICP definition)
*   **Value proposition** : Why should they buy from you?
*   **Sales model** : How do you sell? (Self-service, inside sales, field sales)
*   **Channel strategy** : Where do you find customers?
*   **Pricing & packaging** : How much & how do you charge?

### GTM Model Selection Matrix

Choose based on ACV (Annual Contract Value) & customer segment :

| ACV Range | Customer Type | GTM Motion | Sales Cycle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <$5K | SMB | Product-led, self-service | Days to weeks |
| $5K-$50K | Mid-market | Inside sales | 1-3 months |
| $50K-$250K | Enterprise | Field sales | 3-6 months |
| \>$250K | Strategic | Field sales + partnerships | 6-12+ months |

_Most successful companies use multiple GTM motions for different customer segments_

### The Three GTM Motions

**Product-Led Growth (PLG)**

*   Users adopt product organically
*   Freemium or free trial model
*   Self-service onboarding
*   Viral expansion within accounts
*   Examples : Slack, Zoom, Notion, Figma

**Sales-Led Growth (SLG)**

*   Outbound prospecting drives pipeline
*   Sales reps close deals
*   Custom demos & proposals
*   Longer sales cycles
*   Examples : Salesforce, Workday, ServiceNow

**Hybrid (PLG + SLG)**

*   Product drives initial adoption
*   Sales team expands & converts
*   Best of both worlds
*   Examples : Atlassian, Datadog, MongoDB

### PLG vs SLG : Detailed Comparison

| Factor | Product-Led Growth (PLG) | Sales-Led Growth (SLG) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ideal ACV** | <$5K annually | \>$50K annually |
| **Time to Value** | Minutes to hours | Weeks to months |
| **Buying Process** | Individual or small team decision | Committee, procurement involved |
| **User Adoption** | Viral, bottom-up | Top-down, executive-sponsored |
| **Sales Cycle** | Days to weeks | Months to quarters |
| **Customer Education** | Self-service documentation, product tours | Custom demos, implementation support |
| **Free Trial/Freemium** | Essential for acquisition | Nice-to-have, often not offered |
| **Sales Team Size** | Minimal (conversion & expansion focused) | Large (hunters & farmers) |
| **CAC** | Low ($100-$1K) | High ($10K-$100K+) |
| **Margins** | High (70-90%) | Lower (60-75% due to sales costs) |
| **Onboarding** | Automated, self-service | White-glove, consultative |
| **Product Complexity** | Simple, intuitive | Complex, requires training |
| **Ideal For** | Developers, small teams, SMB | Enterprise, regulated industries, custom needs |

_Most successful companies start with one motion & layer in the other as they scale_

## Sales Model Selection

### Self-Service / Product-Led

**When it works**:

*   Low ACV (<$5K annually)
*   Simple value proposition
*   Fast time to value
*   Individual or small team buyers

**Requirements**:

*   Intuitive product onboarding
*   Clear pricing on website
*   Automated billing & provisioning
*   Product analytics for conversion optimization

**Economics**:

*   High volume, low touch
*   CAC : $100-$500 per customer
*   Payback period : 3-6 months
*   Sales efficiency : Measured by conversion rates, not quota

### Inside Sales

**When it works**:

*   Mid-range ACV ($5K-$50K)
*   Some product complexity
*   Multiple stakeholders
*   Need for consultative selling

**Team structure**:

*   SDRs (Sales Development Reps) : Qualify leads
*   AEs (Account Executives) : Run demos, close deals
*   Ratio : 2-3 SDRs per AE

**Economics**:

*   AE quota : $500K-$1M annually
*   CAC : $5K-$15K per customer
*   Payback period : 6-12 months
*   Sales efficiency : Measured by quota attainment

### Field Sales

**When it works**:

*   High ACV (>$50K)
*   Complex sales process
*   Multiple decision-makers
*   Custom implementation

**Team structure**:

*   Sales Engineers (SEs) : Technical demos & POCs
*   Account Executives : Relationship & deal management
*   Ratio : 1 SE per 2-3 AEs

**Economics**:

*   AE quota : $1M-$3M annually
*   CAC : $25K-$100K+ per customer
*   Payback period : 12-24 months
*   Sales efficiency : Win rate & deal size

## Channel Strategy

### Direct vs Indirect Channels

**Direct sales** (your team sells):

*   Pros : Control, customer relationships, margin
*   Cons : Slow to scale, high fixed costs

**Indirect sales** (partners sell):

*   Pros : Faster market coverage, local expertise
*   Cons : Less control, margin sharing, enablement overhead

### Channel Strategy Comparison

| Factor | Direct Sales | Indirect/Partner Sales | Hybrid Approach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Control** | Complete control over customer experience | Limited, depends on partner execution | Selective control (strategic accounts direct) |
| **Speed to Market** | Slower (need to hire & train) | Faster (leverage existing partner networks) | Moderate (build core direct, scale with partners) |
| **Geographic Reach** | Limited by team size | Broad (partners have local presence) | Best of both (direct in core markets) |
| **Margin** | Full margin (70-80%) | Reduced (share 20-30% with partners) | Mixed (optimize by market) |
| **Fixed Costs** | High (salaries, benefits, infrastructure) | Lower (variable commissions to partners) | Moderate (core direct team + partner costs) |
| **Customer Relationship** | Direct, owned by company | Mediated through partner | Direct for key accounts, partner for volume |
| **Enablement Effort** | Training your team | High (train & support partners) | Medium (two-track enablement) |
| **Sales Cycle** | Standard, predictable | Variable (depends on partner capacity) | Consistent for direct, variable for indirect |
| **Best For** | High-touch enterprise sales, new markets | Scaling established products, niche markets | Growing SaaS companies (0-$50M ARR) |

_Most companies start 100% direct, then layer in partners at scale for specific markets or use cases_

## Positioning & Messaging

### Crafting Your Positioning

April Dunford’s positioning framework :

1.  **Understand your best customers** : Who loves your product & why?
2.  **Form a positioning team** : Cross-functional input (sales, product, marketing)
3.  **Align your positioning** : Competitive alternatives, differentiation, value
4.  **Layer on a trend** : Ride a market wave (AI, remote work, data privacy)
5.  **Capture your positioning** : Document & communicate

### The Positioning Statement

**Template**: “For \[target customer\] who \[need/pain point\], \[product name\] is a \[category\] that \[key benefit\]. Unlike \[competitive alternative\], we \[key differentiator\].”

**Example (Gong)**: “For B2B sales teams who struggle to understand why deals are won or lost, Gong is a revenue intelligence platform that captures & analyzes all customer interactions. Unlike CRMs that rely on manual data entry, we automatically surface insights from actual conversations.”

### Messaging Framework

**Value proposition hierarchy**:

*   **Tagline** : 5-10 words, emotional hook
*   **One-liner** : 1 sentence, what you do
*   **Short pitch** : 2-3 sentences, problem-solution-proof
*   **Elevator pitch** : 30-60 seconds, full story

**Messaging pillars** (3-5 key themes):

*   Each pillar addresses a specific customer pain point
*   Supported by proof points (features, customer stories, data)
*   Consistent across sales, marketing, & product

## Sales Team Structure

### When to Hire Your First Sales Rep

Signals you’re ready :

*   Founder has closed 10+ customers successfully
*   Repeatable sales process documented
*   Clear ICP & messaging
*   Product-market fit achieved
*   $10K+ MRR or consistent pipeline

**First hire : Account Executive (not SDR)**

*   Validate the sales process with a closer first
*   Layer in SDRs once AEs are productive

### Scaling the Sales Team

**Growth trajectory**:

*   0-$1M ARR : 1-2 AEs (generalists)
*   $1M-$5M ARR : 5-10 AEs + 3-5 SDRs (specialization begins)
*   $5M-$20M ARR : 20-30 AEs + SDR team + Sales leadership
*   $20M+ ARR : Segmented teams (SMB, mid-market, enterprise)

### Sales Specialization Model

**The assembly line approach**:

*   **SDRs** : Qualify inbound leads, cold outreach
*   **AEs** : Run demos, negotiate, close deals
*   **CSMs** : Onboard, expand, renew customers
*   **SEs** : Technical demos & proof-of-concepts (for complex products)

**Why specialization works**:

*   Role clarity & skill development
*   Faster ramp time (narrower focus)
*   Better metrics (each role has clear KPIs)
*   Easier to hire & train

### Sales Compensation

**Standard AE comp structure**:

*   50/50 or 60/40 split (base/variable)
*   On-target earnings (OTE) : $150K-$250K+ depending on quota

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is go-to-market strategy?

Go-to-market strategy defines how you acquire customers & generate revenue. It includes identifying your target customer (ICP), defining your value proposition, selecting your sales model (self-service, inside sales, field sales), choosing channels to reach customers, & setting pricing & packaging. A strong GTM strategy aligns product, sales, & marketing around a repeatable customer acquisition engine.

### Should I use product-led or sales-led growth?

Choose product-led growth (PLG) when your ACV is <$5K, time to value is fast, & individual users can make buying decisions. Choose sales-led growth (SLG) when your ACV is >$50K, the product is complex, & you need consultative selling with multiple stakeholders. Most successful companies start with one motion & layer in the other as they scale,for example, Atlassian & Datadog use hybrid approaches.

### When should I hire my first sales rep?

Hire your first sales rep when the founder has closed 10+ customers, you have a documented repeatable sales process, clear ICP & messaging, product-market fit, & $10K+ MRR or consistent pipeline. Your first hire should be an Account Executive (not SDR) to validate the sales process. Layer in SDRs once AEs are productive. Typical timing is $1M-$2M ARR.

### What is revenue operations?

Revenue operations (RevOps) aligns sales, marketing, & customer success through shared systems, processes, data, & metrics. RevOps owns the CRM, marketing automation, sales engagement tools, pipeline reporting, forecast accuracy, quota setting, territory design, & compensation planning. Hire your first RevOps person at 20-30 employees or $5M-$10M ARR when process complexity demands dedicated operations focus.

### How do I find my ideal customer profile?

Define your ICP using firmographic criteria (industry, company size, geography, tech stack) & behavioral signals (growth stage, hiring patterns, funding events). Analyze your best customers,who closes fastest, uses the product most, & has highest retention? Those patterns reveal your ICP. Focus sales & marketing efforts on this profile for higher win rates, faster sales cycles, better retention, & efficient CAC.

### What’s the difference between inside & field sales?

Inside sales works remotely with ACV of $5K-$50K, using SDRs to qualify leads & AEs to run demos & close deals. Sales cycles are 1-3 months with AE quotas of $500K-$1M. Field sales works on-site with ACV >$50K, using Sales Engineers for technical demos & AEs for relationship management. Sales cycles are 3-12+ months with AE quotas of $1M-$3M+. Choose based on deal complexity & customer expectations.

### How much should I pay salespeople?

Standard AE compensation is 50/50 or 60/40 split (base/variable) with OTE of $150K-$250K+ & quota set at 4-5x OTE annually. SDRs typically have 70/30 split with OTE of $60K-$90K, paid on meetings set or opportunities created. VP Sales OTE ranges from $250K-$500K+ with mix of team quota attainment & individual contribution. Add accelerators for over-performance above 100% attainment.

### What is account-based marketing?

Account-based marketing (ABM) is a targeted approach for high-value accounts where you identify 50-500 target companies, research their business & pain points, engage through multiple channels (email, LinkedIn, direct mail, events), coordinate sales & marketing outreach, & measure account engagement rather than lead volume. ABM works best for ACV >$100K with long sales cycles, multiple stakeholders, & strategic named accounts.
