## **Getting there: platforms everywhere, and daring to experiment with new patterns** 

2021 is not a milestone year for platform-ecosystem thinking but rather a step in a process that has its roots – to various extents – in events that have characterized the last decade, or so.

On one hand, we’re living through the progressive evolution of the platform-marketplace model, increasingly being pushed into new verticals. As part of this process, the marketplace model gains popularity in new, often professional, sectors, increasingly mixing with SaaS and service bundles. This coupling makes up a powerful value proposition: providing a basic set of workflows, a so-called “system of records”, and – in some cases – also demand generation, platform-marketplace allows professionals of all kinds to join markets, often leaving existing positions at corporations, in a trend that many call “the great resignation”.

On the other hand, progressive unbundling moves forward, upwards and downwards in the value chain, Most visibly, the fintech world has eventually identified marketplaces are great distribution opportunities and on-ramps for their services that serve as complements and enhancers of user experiences and contribute to the increased appeal of the marketplace pattern.

Furthermore, 2021 is also the year when web 3 and its implications are being effectively integrated into a platform-marketplace stack that involves value exchanges that happen “off-chain” (i.e.: exchange of services, products that do not just exist as tokenized assets on a blockchain). Despite most of the efforts in integrating smart contracts into the marketplace code, or to adopt data and reputation portability, are just starting up, one massive success story, that of Braintrust, has shown that web 3, tokenization mechanisms can be integrated as a way to empower the network participants to provide network services (such as bringing in referrals, vetting producers, and more) and receive network value back in the form of governance-related tokens. Braintrust’s pioneering model, that of web 3 marketplaces, holds massive promises and I bet we’re going to see more experiments, along with this pattern, growing massively in 2022 possibly displacing existing traditional company backed marketplaces.

More attempts are being made to rethink traditional dynamics of real-world commerce and trade according to the new possibility of web 3 aiming at “unbundling” the various layers and pieces: the marketplace from its governance, the supply aggregation side from the demand aggregation side, and more. Boson Protocol is a project to keep an eye on, in this space.

Verticalization of marketplaces and the emergence of powerful “software stack” that are somewhat able to substitute the advantages of belonging to a corporation, are not the only entrepreneurial enabling trend we’re seeing: no-code is another signal pushing towards more entrepreneurial sovereignty and major growth of the role of micro-entrepreneurialism in rebuilding different economic patterns.

Coupling these trends: the unbundling of the corporation and the empowerment of the micro-entrepreneur – or team – and a progressive affirmation of protocol-based, inclusive governance, tokenized organizations is certainly signalling that a real end of bureaucracy is – perhaps eventually – in sight, at least for some sectors of the economy. If heavy industries still have to rely on bureaucratic top-down hierarchies, the competitiveness of swarm-like, contract based organizations becomes more competitive by the day at least in knowledge work, finance and commerce.

I predict that 2022 will be an interesting year that will bring up key questions about building deliberately open, cooperative systems – platforms, infrastructures, marketplaces – that are  integrative enough to maximally reduce the case for competition and maximally augment the case for collaboration and shared ownership. The idea of [_“outcooperating the competition”_](https://boundaryless.io/blog/outcooperating-the-competition/) and building “last movers” will be not only more tempting, meaningful, and attractive but also look relatively more at hand as we discover more patterns, primitives and enabling technological solutions and as design practices get developed for entrepreneurs and designers to engage with this possibility.

At Boundaryless we are already working on such design tools, in a way to integrate them with our library of exploration, strategy design, growth, and validation practices and this is going to certainly be one of our focus for 2022.

In the sections below, the reader will find four major sections:

*   **The Continued Evolution of Marketplaces, platforms:** collecting links covering new emerging patterns with regards to marketplaces and platform evolution, and learning resources for builders;
*   **The social and regulatory implications of the platform economy and new approaches to it:** covering reads and links discussing the large scale, systemic questions that are emerging as the internet pervades everything;
*   **The Evolution of work and organizing:** exploring the implications of a disappearing boundary between markets and organizations, software-driven organizing, decentralization and self-management updates from 2021;
*   **Informative Breakdowns:** where we link you to precious deep dives around the most important business and networks in the industry so that you can learn from the inner workings of the best.

For each section, you’ll find a short intro, links we’ve curated, some additional links from our writing at Boundaryless, and links to some of the episodes of the [Boundaryless Conversations Podcast](https://boundaryless.io/resources/podcast/) episodes of 2021.

This year you won’t find much about what’s coming up at Boundaryless cause we recently covered a lot of this in our new brand presentation post that we encourage you to catch up with here: [We are Boundaryless](https://boundaryless.io/blog/we-are-boundaryless/).

Thanks so much for bearing with us in 2021, stay tuned for more and – hopefully – enjoy a well-deserved break if you can!

## **The Continued Evolution of Marketplaces, platforms** 

As said above, the marketplace-platform space is hot and growing, entering new verticals, developing further integration with finance, exploring new possibilities in governance and network involvement, and more. Here’s a list of key reads, videos and podcasts you may have missed:

**Best Links on the Continued evolution of Marketplaces, platforms**

[Why the next professional network will look nothing like LinkedIn (substack.com)](https://wfh.substack.com/p/why-the-next-professional-network) **#Blog**

Very nice take from Brianne Kimmel on the Unbundling of LinkedIn. It’s clear how there exists a pressure to re-bundle personal brands with job opportunities, work portfolio, AND especially with workflow, in more specialized niches. Great stuff to ponder about.

[How to Eat an Elephant, One Atomic Concept at a Time – kwokchain](https://kwokchain.com/2021/02/05/atomic-concepts/) **#Blog**

In this amazing essay, Kevin Kwok introduces a new lens to generate growth in product-based ecosystems: finding the right atomic concepts looks a lot like changing the zooming scale on a certain ecosystem of interactions until you do not resonate with the right “jobs to be done”.

[Enterprise Gateway Marketplaces Will Turn Large Organizations Inside-Out (nfx.com)](https://www.nfx.com/post/enterprise-gateway-marketplaces/) **#Blog**

NFX Guild maps the pattern of Enterprise Gateway Marketplaces (EGMs, essentially purchasing marketplaces where BUs are connected to 3rd parties), which marks a transition. We need to pay attention as it unfolds: it’s co-evolving with further unbundling of the corporation.

In  short, EGMs seem an excellent workaround to the internal purchasing bureaucracy that holds back innovation in many large corporations today. However, the problem is bureaucracy, not necessarily decentralized purchasing. On the other hand, EGMs signal that the process of unbundling of the corporation, going from 1:1 to 1:N contracting,  towards N:N contracting (micro-enterprises, fully unbundled  organisation) is well underway.

[Marketplace Supply Strategy: Comprehensive, Exclusive, or Curated (a16z.com)](https://a16z.com/2021/03/31/marketplace-supply-strategy/) **#Blog**

Another truly excellent essay by Casey Winters: packed with insights. A few here:

[Market-Making on the Internet – Stratechery by Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2021/market-making-on-the-internet/) **#Blog**

“What makes Shopify so fascinating is that over time more and more of the e-commerce it enables happens somewhere other than a Shopify website.” In this key reflection, Ben Thompson expands on the transition from an ad-based aggregation theory, and thus centralization based, towards a connect-and-leverage-based direct monetization pattern. This allows creators on the internet to distribute their content across attention contexts, without having to sacrifice their sovereignty.

Like in the past years, we’re reading and listening to a lot of conversations around the evolution of the organization, it’s inner workings and its relationship with teams and workers, the role of shared infrastructures in enabling inter-organizational communications, and how organizations are evolving to fit such an incredibly evolving environment. These are some of the key reads we’ve found this year.
