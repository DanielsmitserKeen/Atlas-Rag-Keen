# How to Upsell SaaS Product \[Step-by-Step Guide\]

To effectively increase revenue from existing customers, it is necessary to implement a strategy to upsell a SaaS product. This process focuses on encouraging customers to purchase a higher-value version of the product they already use. A well-executed SaaS upsell strategy can offset churn and greatly influence a SaaS company’s [Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)](https://payproglobal.com/answers/what-is-annual-recurring-revenue-arr/) and [Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)](https://payproglobal.com/answers/what-is-monthly-recurring-revenue-mrr/). This guide will provide detailed, actionable steps on how to identify upsell opportunities, implement successful tactics, and improve client lifetime value.

Step 1

## Understand the Fundamentals of SaaS Upsell

Upsell SaaS is the practice of persuading current, satisfied customers to upgrade to a more advanced or feature-rich version of your existing SaaS product. This contrasts with cross-sell SaaS, which involves selling additional, complementary products. The primary goal of upselling is to increase the [Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)](https://payproglobal.com/answers/what-is-average-revenue-per-user-arpu-in-saas/) and [Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)](https://payproglobal.com/answers/what-is-customer-lifetime-value-clv/). Research indicates that the conversion rate for upselling to [freemium](https://payproglobal.com/answers/what-is-saas-freemium-model/) users can be significantly higher (8%-20%) than onboarding new users to a [free trial](https://payproglobal.com/answers/what-are-saas-free-trials/) (3%-10%). Understanding the stages involved is super important for a systematic approach:

*   **Recognize Prospective Candidates:** This initial and ongoing stage involves pinpointing customers who exhibit characteristics making them likely to benefit from and be receptive to an upsell. This calls for a solid understanding of your customer base and their usage patterns. Implement robust CRM analytics to track feature usage frequency, usage depth, and consumption limits.  
    _For instance,_ if a user on a basic plan frequently uses all allocated integrations or storage, they are a prime candidate.  
    Analyze engagement metrics like login frequency and feature interaction. Customers exhibiting high engagement are often more receptive to expanded capabilities. Segment your user base based on key metrics (e.g., usage thresholds, plan tenure, industry, company size) to streamline identification.

*   **Qualify the Opportunity:** Not every identified customer is immediately ready or suitable for an upsell. This stage involves validating their need for a higher-tier offering and assessing their capacity and willingness to invest. Customer Success Managers (CSMs) are super important here. Equip them with know-how from your CRM and usage analytics to have informed conversations. Understand the customer’s business goals and challenges. Determine if the limitations of their current plan are hindering their progress. Assess their budget and decision-making process.  
    _Example:_ A CSM proactively reaches out to the project management user exceeding project limits and discovers their team is rapidly expanding, necessitating more user seats and advanced collaboration features.

Note

According to [the resources](https://www.insivia.com/quoter/the-average-saas-business-generates-16-of-its-new-annual-contract-value-acv-from-upselling-to-existing-customers/), the average SaaS business generates 16% of its new Annual Contract Value (ACV) from upselling, pointing out its financial significance.

*   **Present the Value Proposition:** Once a customer is qualified, the next important part is to introduce the upsell offer in a compelling way. Focus on the value they will gain, not just the features. Tailor your presentation to the customer’s unique requirements and pain points identified during qualification. Clearly articulate how the upgraded plan or features will directly solve their problems, improve their efficiency, or help them achieve their goals. Use visuals (demos, videos) to showcase the enhanced capabilities. Highlight the ROI they can expect.

Tip

Use case studies and testimonials from other customers who have benefited from the upgrade. BuzzSumo highlights a part of its website to customer success stories, providing social proof.

*   **Close the Upsell.** Secure the upgrade. Make the process seamless and correct any remaining objections or concerns. Provide clear and straightforward upgrade paths within your application and billing system. Offer flexible payment options. Use a trial period for the upgraded features if possible, reducing perceived risk. Take care of any questions promptly and professionally. Clearly explain the transition process and support available post-upgrade. For instance, offer the project management team a 14-day free trial of the enterprise plan which includes dedicated support focused on [improving their SaaS customer onboarding experience](https://payproglobal.com/how-to/improve-saas-customer-onboarding-experience/) to that higher, more complex tier.

Note

Offering [embedded payment processing](https://payproglobal.com/answers/what-is-saas-embedded-integration/) within a SaaS product is a valuable upsell, providing a one-stop solution and increasing customer trust.

Step 2

## Determine Upsell Opportunities

Identifying upsell opportunities requires a multi-faceted approach and a thorough understanding of your customer lifecycle.

*   **In-Depth Analysis of Customer Behavior:** Look past basic usage metrics. Know which features are most and least used by different customer segments. Find power users who would benefit from advanced features. Identify patterns in feature adoption that precede upgrades. 
*   **Proactively Collect Customer Feedback:** Don’t wait for customers to complain. Implement proactive feedback mechanisms at various touchpoints. For methods on how to effectively do this, see [how to collect user feedback](https://payproglobal.com/how-to/collect-user-feedback-for-saas/) for your SaaS.   
    Use targeted surveys after key milestones (e.g., feature adoption, reaching usage thresholds). Develop in-app feedback prompts. Watch social media and online reviews for mentions of any unmet needs.  
    Send a survey to users whose storage limits are nearly full, asking about future data needs, to locate upsell opportunities. Analyze revenue churn for valuable learning opportunities. When customers downgrade or cancel, ask them for detailed feedback on their reasons for leaving. This helps identify missing features or limitations to utilize in higher-tier plans.
*   **Leveraging Customer Success Manager Insights:** CSMs have direct relationships with customers and should be equipped with the right tools and training to identify and articulate upsell opportunities. Schedule regular communication and knowledge sharing between sales, product, and CSM teams.  
    _Example,_ A CSM notices a customer manually performing tasks that are automated in a higher-tier plan and reaches out to suggest an upgrade. Track CSM performance on identifying and facilitating upsells as part of their performance.
*   **Strategic Monitoring of Usage Patterns and Limits:** Implement alerts and notifications to measure key usage metrics. Track users who are approaching plan limits (e.g., number of users, storage, API calls). determine users who consistently use premium trial features. Monitor the frequency of encountering gated features.

Example

Dropbox is proactive with reminders  about the benefits of upgrading for additional space when they are close to their current limit.  
Intercom strategically creates friction points by gating advanced features after users have invested time in using the basic functionality, increasing the likelihood of an upgrade.

Tip

Study cohort analysis to track how feature usage evolves over time for different customer groups.

Step 3

## Craft a Compelling SaaS Upsell Strategy

A well-defined SaaS upsell strategy should go with your overall business goals and focus on delivering continuous value to your existing customers. Here are some tips and SaaS upsell examples:

*   **Strategic Tiered Pricing Architecture:** Create your pricing tiers with clear differentiators and logical upgrade paths. Explore [solutions for implementing tiered pricing](https://payproglobal.com/solutions/implementing-tiered-pricing/) that naturally guide users towards valuable upsell opportunities as their needs grow. Outline the features and benefits included in each plan in a comparison table. The progression of features should match with the natural growth and changing needs of your customer segments. The difference in functionality between tiers should be easily recognizable to incentivize upgrades.  
    Consider giving various payment plans (monthly, annual) and  different payment methods to appeal to a wider range of customer preferences. The choice of payment processor influences transaction fees and the overall customer experience. Find a payment processor that supports your pricing architecture.

**Example:** 

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Feature** | **Basic Plan** | **Pro Plan** | **Enterprise Plan** |
| Users | 5   | 25  | Unlimited |
| Storage | 10GB | 100GB | 1TB |
| Reporting | Basic | Advanced | Customizable |
| Integrations | 3   | 10  | Unlimited |
| Customer Support | Email | Priority | Dedicated |
| **Price (Monthly)** | **$29** | **$99** | **$299+** |

Avoid making the feature differences between adjacent tiers too small, as this reduces the incentive to upgrade. As highlighted in the resources, if users don’t perceive significant new services after a Pro plan purchase, the motivation to upgrade to Enterprise diminishes.

*   **Strategic Feature Gating and Limited Trials:** Intentionally restrict advanced, high-value features to higher-tier plans, offering limited-time or limited-usage trials to showcase their benefits.  
    Highlight gated features within the user interface, clearly indicating their availability in higher plans. Offer “try for free” options for premium features with usage limits (e.g., Grammarly allowing limited premium feature usage).

Example

ClickUp strategically lists premium features in the navigation menu, prompting an upgrade when a user tries to access them, clearly outlining the benefits of the higher plan.

*   **Usage-Based Upsell Triggers:** Implement automated systems to identify and trigger upsell prompts based on usage thresholds. Set up in-app notifications or email sequences that activate when users approach or exceed limits on key metrics (e.g., number of records, API calls, processing volume). Clearly explain the consequences of hitting the limit and the benefits of upgrading.

Example

Loom’s upsell prompt appears when users are close to their recording time limit, highlighting the benefits of unlimited recording in a higher tier.

*   **Focus on Value Communication:** Clearly and consistently communicate the value proposition of upgrading. Emphasize the benefits, not just the features. Use clear and concise language in all upsell communications. Focus on how the upgrade will solve specific problems, save time, improve efficiency, or drive better results for the customer.
*   **Personalized Upsell Messaging and Offers:** Leverage customer data and behavioral insights to deliver tailored upsell messages. Segment your audience based on usage, industry, company size, and engagement. Craft upsell offers that directly address the specific needs and potential ROI for each segment.

Example

Pendo personalizes upsell offers by introducing relevant features to users based on their in-app behavior, offering demos for features available in higher plans.

Step 4

## Implement Effective Upsell Tactics

The execution of your upsell strategy relies on deploying the right tactics at the right time through the appropriate channels.

**Strategic In-App Messaging and Prompts:** Utilize non-intrusive in-app messages (banners, tooltips, modals) to highlight upgrade benefits and opportunities within the user’s workflow. Trigger in-app messages contextually based on user behavior (e.g., reaching a limit, attempting to use a gated feature). Ensure clear Call-to-Actions (CTAs) for upgrading or learning more.

Example

Zapier uses a persistent in-app banner reminding users of their trial period for paid features, creating a sense of urgency. Miro displays an upgrade prompt when users attempt to create more boards than their current plan allows, explaining the consequences.

**Targeted Email Marketing Campaigns:** Design email sequences specifically focused on upselling. Segment your email list based on upgrade potential and tailor the messaging accordingly. Send emails highlighting new premium features, offering limited-time upgrade discounts, or reminding users of the benefits they missed during a trial. Personalize email content based on the user’s usage and plan.

Example

Airtable complements its in-app prompts with email newsletters that educate users on premium features and their benefits.

**Proactive Customer Success Outreach:** Equip CSMs to identify and initiate upsell conversations based on their understanding of the customer’s needs and the product roadmap. Train CSMs on how to identify upsell triggers and effectively communicate the value of upgrading. Provide them with talking points and resources (e.g., case studies, ROI calculators). The CSM department is often the primary driver of upsell, responsible for ensuring customer success and identifying expansion opportunities.

**Seamless Upgrade Process:** Make it easy for customers to upgrade their plans with minimal friction. Provide a clear and intuitive upgrade path within the application’s settings or billing section. Offer various payment methods that are convenient for your target audience, such as credit cards, debit cards, and potentially other options like PayPal or direct bank transfers. Ensure a smooth transition to the new plan without data loss or service interruption.

Example

Loom provides an easy upgrade button within the application when users hit recording limits.

**Leveraging Downgrade Reminders:** When users attempt to downgrade, remind them of the premium features they utilized and the value they received.

Example

Canva shows a downgrade prompt highlighting how many times the user used certain premium features during their trial, suggesting they reconsider upgrading.

Step 5

## Measure SaaS Upsell Metrics

Tracking the right SaaS upsell metrics provides critical insights into the success of your efforts and identifies areas for optimization.

*   **Upsell Conversion Rate:** Calculate the percentage of existing customers who upgrade their subscription within a specific period.  
    _Formula:_ (Number of Upgraded Customers / Total Number of Existing Customers) \* 100%. [SaaS conversion rate calculator](https://payproglobal.com/saas-metrics-calculators/saas-conversion-rate-calculator/) can be adapted to measure this specific upsell success and the effectiveness of your campaigns.
*   **[Expansion MRR](https://payproglobal.com/answers/what-is-saas-expansion-mrr/) (or ARR):** Measure the increase in monthly (or annual) recurring revenue specifically from upselling existing customers.
*   **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Uplift:** Analyze how upselling contributes to the overall increase in the predicted revenue a customer will generate over their entire relationship with your company.
*   **[Net Dollar Retention (NDR)](https://payproglobal.com/answers/what-is-saas-net-dollar-retention-ndr/):** This metric is the percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers after accounting for upgrades, downgrades, and churn. An NDR above 100% means that your expansion revenue (including upsells) is more than offsetting your losses.  
    _Formula:_ ((MRR at Start of Period + Expansion MRR – Contraction MRR – Churned MRR) / MRR at Start of Period) \* 100%
*   **Average Upgrade Value:** Calculate the average revenue increase per upsell transaction.  
    _Formula:_ Total Expansion MRR (from Upsells) / Number of Upsell Transactions
*   **Time to Upsell:** Track the average time it takes for a customer to upgrade after their initial purchase.

Step 6

## Refine and Optimize Your Approach

Upselling is not a static activity. You need to analysis and optimize at all times to maximize its impact.

*   **[A/B Testing](https://payproglobal.com/how-to/run-checkout-a-b-testing-for-saas/) of Upsell Messaging and Offers:** Experiment with different in-app messages, email subject lines, offer structures, and CTAs to identify what resonates best with your audience. 
*   **Regular Analysis of Upsell Performance:** Monitor your key SaaS upsell metrics regularly. Identify trends, successes, and areas where improvement is needed.
*   **Gathering Feedback on Upsell Attempts:** [Solicit feedback from customers](https://payproglobal.com/how-to/collect-user-feedback-for-saas/) who did and did not upgrade to understand their motivations and barriers.
*   **Iterative Adjustments to Strategy and Tactics:** Based on your analysis and feedback, make data-driven adjustments to your pricing tiers, feature gating, messaging, and outreach strategies.
*   **Collaboration Across Departments:** Ensure seamless collaboration between product, sales, customer success, and marketing teams to align on the upsell strategy and execution. The Product & Research department’s product function design forms the basis of SaaS upsell. The Sales department may need to assist CSMs in closing upsell deals if there are no dedicated AM staff.

By following these detailed steps and continuously adapting your approach, you can build a robust and effective SaaS upsell strategy that significantly contributes to your company’s growth and long-term success.
