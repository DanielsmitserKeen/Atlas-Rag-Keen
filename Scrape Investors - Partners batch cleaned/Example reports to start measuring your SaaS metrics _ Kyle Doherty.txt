# Example reports to start measuring your SaaS metrics

## Kyle Doherty’s Post

Every startup says they want to be data driven but often we find they aren’t measuring even the basics. These are the absolute essentials you need to run and grow your business. If you don’t have these go figure them out ASAP!

How do you start measuring the right SaaS metrics? I’ve found the following essential for SaaS startups that reach PMF. Go in this order for insights at a pace that you can act on: 💰Revenue: Unless your users are the product, this is your north star (h/t Bobby Pinero) 💸Cash Burn: Mind your burn and runway, but start factoring in revenue too 📊Retention: SaaS startups live or die by retention - get this right 🎯Acquisition: Early growth is almost all from new customers Let’s dive into each: (see slides for examples)  💰Revenue Model  This shows Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) by its components:  -New MRR: customers who started that month  -Retained MRR: customers retained from the prior month  -Expansion (Contraction) MRR: any increase (decrease) in spend by retained customers  -Churned MRR: loss from customers who churned  -Resurrected MRR: churned customers who came back It’s your core model as a SaaS business because it shows exactly how you gain (or lose) customers and MRR each month. Use it to diagnose trends, forecast, model scenarios, set goals, and track progress. 💸Cash Burn Model  The cost counterpart to your Revenue Model, this breaks monthly spend into headcount, overhead, recurring, and one-off components that draw down your cash balance over time. ✅ Create this model (or update an existing one) to use live data from the Revenue Model, so you can see the impact of your growth on your runway.  ✅ Together, the Cash Burn and Revenue Models reveal if you are “default alive 🌱” or “default dead ☠️” Use them for reviews, planning, investor updates, scenarios, and any major business decisions. 📊Retention Cohort Analysis  This model shows how much of each new cohort’s customers and MRR are retained in the months after the first billing date. Its triangle-shaped cohort charts show absolute and net (% of starting) retention for customers and MRR, helping assess churn and overall growth. ✅ Apply conditional formatting to your net customer retention chart, to diagnose structural vs. one-off churn. For example, regular month 2 churn may be remedied with onboarding but one-time spikes across cohorts may be one-off (e.g. an outage).  ✅ Evaluate 12 month net customer and MRR retention. Under 50% for customers or < 100% for MRR is bad, as you lose ½ the customers and barely keep the MRR you worked so hard for! 🎯Acquisition Funnel Analysis    This model tracks volume, conversion, and time to convert for funnel stages up to Customer. It helps you set benchmarks for these metrics, pinpoint issues by funnel stage, and create a single source of truth for how you get new customers. ✅ Manage your funnel to consistently hit your targets.  ✅ Use this as a starting point for Attribution, Lead Scoring or other optimizations.
