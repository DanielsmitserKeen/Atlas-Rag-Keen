# How to Create a GTM Strategy for SMBs

Every small and medium business has its origins as a startup with a big idea. But as the company grows, what worked early on – like word of mouth or a few key clients – won’t be enough to sustain momentum.

To scale, SMBs need a [go-to-market strategy](https://aisdr.com/blog/go-to-market-strategy/) that builds on their success while expanding to new channels and audiences. The trick is finding the right approach that drives growth _without_ losing traction or weakening a competitive edge.

Here’s a walkthrough of how SMBs can create and [execute a GTM strategy](https://aisdr.com/blog/expert-insights-about-gtm-strategy-january-2025/) that works.

## GTM strategy explained

A GTM strategy is a company’s action plan on how to “go to market” and sell a specific product or service (hence the name). This action plan usually provides a breakdown of how to connect with the target audience, build awareness, and turn prospects and non-paying users into buyers.

Like any other GTM, a GTM for SMBs sheds light on a product’s positioning, pricing, and sales channels. 

## GTM strategy: Who needs it?

All businesses need a GTM strategy, and SMBs are no exception. The better the strategy, the better a company will run different plays and tactics on a target audience. 

However, GTM strategies need to also account for the company’s size, service, and financial constraints.

Enterprises have massive budgets that allow [GTM engineers](https://aisdr.com/blog/gtm-engineer/) to do whatever they want while start-ups and SMBs operate under tighter constraints and rely on rapid iteration to fix any GTM issues.

## Why do SMBs need a strong GTM strategy?

A GTM strategy is similar to a [product roadmap](https://aisdr.com/blog/leadership-nuggets-agile-product-roadmap/). But instead of mapping out a product’s evolution, a [GTM strategy](https://aisdr.com/blog/saas-gtm-strategy/) outlines how an SMB will reach the right customers and drive sales.

These are some of the benefits SMBs gain from a strong GTM plan:

*   **Positioning in a [crowded market](https://aisdr.com/blog/leadership-nuggets-market-differentiation/)** – A GTM strategy ensures that each initiative, feature launch, or sales push fits into the larger plan.
*   **Personalized efforts** – Specific research into customer pain points helps shape messages that engage audiences and convert them into customers.
*   **Fewer missteps** – A clear structure reduces the guesswork and steers resources where they deliver viable returns, increasing the chances of a successful launch.
*   **Bigger impact at launch** – Research, planning, and marketing allow you to reach an audience and leave a positive impression on potential buyers.
*   **Sustained momentum** – A continuous feedback loop within the GTM strategy helps you identify areas for improvement to sustain market presence beyond launch.
*   **Extended reach** – SMBs can expand their marketing with side projects and other offshoots under a consistent identity. For example, a consulting firm can start a webinar series or a blog to capture more audiences.
*   **Ensured regulatory compliance** – A GTM strategy details how the business will address regulatory requirements, reducing the risk of fines, costly legal disputes, or reputational damage.
*   **Reduced time to market** – Understanding the audience, setting clear launch goals, and practicing effective project management are key elements of a GTM strategy that streamline product development.

A robust and flexible SMB GTM strategy lays the groundwork for long-term success and helps you pivot after launch. You can even delegate [part of your GTM strategy](https://aisdr.com/blog/ai-gtm-strategy/) to AI.

## What makes a GTM strategy for SMBs unique?

[Startups](https://aisdr.com/blog/best-sales-tools-for-startups-reach-series-a-level-growth/) and SMBs lack the resources of enterprises, but they can thrive by highlighting their unique selling points, focusing on high-impact growth channels, and staying agile.

But what makes a GTM strategy for SMBs different from a [startup’s GTM](https://aisdr.com/blog/startup-gtm-strategy/) is the potential existence of a product-market fit.

Many SMBs have achieved some level of PMF (meaning they’ve found a market that values their product), but some SMBs may still be refining their offer. 

The GTM strategy’s design should reflect this difference:

*   **If an SMB has PMF**, its GTM strategy focuses on scaling, optimizing sales channels, and expanding to new markets.
*   **If an SMB is still searching for PMF**, its GTM strategy likely involves more testing, additional customer feedback loops, and adjustments to pricing and positioning.

SMBs often sit in a sort of ‘transition phase’ where early traction and potential PMF exist, but sustainable growth requires further improvements to the product, better customer acquisition, and solidified positioning.

## Elements of a GTM strategy for SMBs

Like other GTM plans, an SMB’s GTM strategy consists of multiple elements.

### Buyer personas & audience segments

Even though they’re ready to expand to [new markets](https://aisdr.com/blog/ai-in-market-research-key-techniques-and-15-best-tools-for-entering-new-markets/), SMBs need to avoid diluting their messaging by targeting too many audiences at once. 

To ground your targeting, you can leverage [ideal customer profiles](https://aisdr.com/blog/how-ideal-customer-profiles-benefit-your-business/), adding 1-2 more once you see predictable sales traction within a target market. In time, as you establish a presence, the messaging can be segmented to match different groups.

**Example 1**

A boutique skincare company might identify two core audiences: eco-conscious buyers who like natural ingredients and younger consumers who value affordability and trendy branding.

**Example 2**

A time-management app might discover that the highest engagement comes from small team leads working remotely and bigger companies that need seamless calendar syncing and use this insight to adapt its messaging and features.

### Target market

You should assess the broader market in which you operate, including industry trends, [competitor offerings](https://aisdr.com/blog/leadership-nuggets-4-hacks-for-stealthy-competitor-analysis/), average price points, and customer pools.

Proper research will help you understand what drives demand and how you can stand out from competitors. Additionally, it will identify growth potential, whether it’s shifting customer preferences or an audience eager for a solution like yours.

**Example 1**

A local floral shop can research local venues to identify gaps it can fill, such as a lack of mid-priced event packages in the area.

**Example 2**

A meal prep company can offer high-protein, low-carb meals in areas with many gyms or CrossFit clubs.

### Unique value proposition and brand messaging

A unique value proposition in your GTM strategy highlights how you stand out and determines your communication style.

This often involves breaking down the product or service into its most essential attributes. Rather than listing features, the message should emphasize how the offering delivers real outcomes for customers.

**Example 1**

An AI-driven tool that automates data entry and lead scoring can highlight how it cuts work hours, allowing users to focus on high-priority tasks.

**Example 2**

A bakery might want to emphasize that its ingredients are sourced from local farms and that the pastry is freshly baked every morning.

### Pricing model

Pricing strategy shapes how customers perceive value and how often they return. 

The right approach involves experimenting with various models. Some companies use straightforward, one-time fees, while [SaaS companies use multiple pricing models](https://aisdr.com/blog/common-saas-pricing-models/).

**Example 1**

A tiered subscription-based plan that can satisfy more audiences, such as a small tier for start-ups and individuals or a large tier for enterprises.

**Example 2**

A free plan with basic features and lock advanced ones under a premium level, i.e. freemium.

**Example 3**

Free trials that demonstrate your product’s immediate value before running targeted cross-sell or up-sell campaigns.

### Sales strategy

A [sales strategy](https://aisdr.com/blog/b2b-sales-channels/) considers where a target audience prefers to discover, evaluate, and purchase a product or service. SMBs should outline their tactics in the GTM plan, describing how each avenue connects with potential customers. 

**Example 1**

An IT consulting firm can sell custom cybersecurity solutions via direct sales. Since the deals require detailed discovery and tailored proposals, [sales reps](https://aisdr.com/blog/ai-sdr-ai-bdr-ai-sales-rep/) schedule in-person demos and workshops to address clients’ pain points.

**Example 2**

A project management software company can offer a freemium model that allows small business owners to sign up without speaking to a sales rep. Automated email drip campaigns guide users through onboarding and highlight premium features.

### Marketing

A GTM strategy covers how an SMB builds awareness, engages audiences, and stays relevant. Focus on the most effective channels to ensure that your brand reaches the right audience at the right time. 

**Example 1**

Small and medium businesses targeting consumers might determine that ads on Meta (Instagram and Facebook) work best with their demographics and direct the marketing to these platforms (instead LinkedIn).

**Example 2**

SMBs may identify the best channel to re-target users who have interacted with their website or app without purchasing, allowing them to re-target them with targeted ads that showcase limited-time discounts.

### Partnerships and external support

Relying solely on internal resources can limit your market reach.

Collaborations with agencies, [influencers](https://aisdr.com/blog/aisdr-product-spotlight-14-linkedin-influencer-targeting/), or complementary brands can help you connect with a wider audience. Moreover, through partnerships, you can bring outside experts on board and bridge skill set gaps without the overhead of hiring full-time staff.

**Example 1**

An independent bookstore could partner with a local café, designing a joint loyalty program to get a free coffee when purchasing a certain number of books or earn a book discount. Both businesses could also reach one another’s customers through email newsletters and in-store promotions.

**Example 2**

Influencer marketing, such as an online coffee roaster collaborating with Instagram influencers to push their product and offer special discounts.

**Example 3**

Event sponsorships, such as a small restaurant sponsoring a local food festival or an SaaS company sponsoring a niche tech conference.

### Budget and resource allocation

A GTM plan should outline priority investments based on the research and performance evaluations. This is especially important for SMBs that need to squeeze the most out of its resources.

**Example 1**

A small e-commerce business might allocate:

*   40% to digital marketing (SEO, content, paid ads)
*   30% to sales tools and CRM software
*   20% to product promotions and discounts
*   10% to customer support

**Example 2**

A brick-and-mortar clothing store launching online sales might allocate:

*   40% to website development, hosting, and e-commerce fees
*   30% to digital marketing (paid ads, social media marketing, influencer partnerships, email)
*   20% to inventory expansion and logistics
*   10% to tools and training for handling online orders

### Key performance indicators (KPIs)

KPIs help measure progress, evaluate success, and identify elements that need refinement. By setting concrete metrics early and continuously monitoring them, SMBs will catch early signs of underperforming campaigns. 

Just keep in mind that not all KPIs are important. You’ll need to figure out [which are relevant](https://aisdr.com/blog/guide-to-outbound-sales-metrics/) to you.

**Customer acquisition cost**

Customer acquisition cost measures the expense of converting a single customer, factoring in costs (such as marketing tool subscriptions, ad spending, etc.). It’s critical to determine the cost-effectiveness of campaigns for SMBs on lean budgets.

**Webpage conversion rate**

Page conversion rate helps understand how many visitors sign up or buy from specific pages. This indicator helps you see if your site is effectively guiding users through the sales funnel.

**Churn rate**

Churn rate measures how many customers stop using the service within a given period. It’s a critical metric for growth if you have a subscription-based model or repeat-purchase services.

## Steps for creating a GTM strategy for SMBs

When SMBs create a clear GTM strategy, they unlock several opportunities and can optimize spend. Here’s a step-by-step look at how SMBs can create a strategy.

### Define your target audience

[Identify the real problem](https://aisdr.com/blog/what-is-intent-based-marketing/) in the market and the audiences that will benefit from your solution.

The research should focus on demographics (user location, age, profession, income level), behavior (buying frequency, product usage patterns, engagement levels), and psychographic insights (interests, values, lifestyle). Determining your audience’s motivations, goals, and pain points is also important.

#### Tools to use

*   HubSpot’s CRM platform connects data from your services, marketing, and sales to provide in-depth customer analytics.

### Outline your value proposition

The SMB go-to-market strategy must clearly explain why customers should choose your product over competitors. 

Articulate the specific benefits you deliver and how they address your audience’s problems. The benefits must be substantial and measurable. Explain clearly how much time or money your solution can save.

#### Tools to use

*   AiSDR reads your website and creates a sales persona that outlines your value propositions and figures out ways to overcome objections.
*   SurveyMonkey allows you to gather direct feedback from users via surveys and use it to refine your value proposition.

Setting the right price starts with a clear grasp of production costs, customer purchasing power, and competitor pricing. Equally important is testing pricing strategies with smaller groups to validate your assumptions.

#### Tools to use

*   QuickBooks calculates the right price for your services or products based on production, marketing, and overhead costs.
*   Pricer24 and similar tools analyze stock prices on competitor’s websites.

### Choose your approach and tactics

Decide on the tactics you will use to reach customers and generate traction.

The key is to align your methods with your audience’s habits and preferences. Avoid sticking only to your initial choices, such as direct marketing or social media ads. Instead, experiment and refine your approach to find what works best.

#### Tools to use

*   Google Analytics monitors traffic sources, tracks user behavior, and identifies top-performing pages.

#### Tools to use

*   AiSDR can analyze metrics from multiple platforms and enterprise tools under one advanced analytical dashboard.
*   Google Search Console allows monitoring your website’s SEO performance, including visits, click-through rates, and keyword rankings.

## Common mistakes SMBs make in their GTM strategy

Creating a GTM strategy isn’t simple, and there are many spots that can trip up an SMB.

Here are some of the most common issues:

*   **No defined target audience** – The costs of chasing too many markets and user groups can be too high for small and medium-sized businesses. Focus on one specific audience to fully address their unique needs.
*   **Weak value proposition** – Most customers will move on if they don’t immediately see your value. SMBs must work harder to explain how their services can help their customers better than solutions from bigger companies.
*   **Poor sales and marketing alignment** – Sales and marketing sometimes operate as separate silos, leading to inconsistent [brand messaging](https://aisdr.com/blog/leadership-nuggets-marketing-messaging/). Your GTM strategy should outline shared objectives, timelines, and communication guidelines.
*   **Inconsistent messaging across channels** – Customers often learn about your business from multiple sources, such as social media, email newsletters, or a company website. If these channels deliver conflicting messages, it can undermine trust in a smaller and less-known company.
*   **Neglecting performance improvements** – [Potential buyers](https://aisdr.com/blog/what-is-a-buyer-persona/) get frustrated and leave if you don’t introduce improvements and new features. Monitoring metrics such as page load times or abandoned carts can suggest actionable solutions.
*   **Ignoring customer feedback** – Many smaller companies ignore input from users after launch. Always maintain a connection and listen to their feedback even if your KPIs seem fine.
*   **Neglecting competitive positioning** – Competitive research can be a lifeline for SMBs that lack the brand reach and capital of established rivals. Carefully research direct and indirect competitors to highlight gaps in their offerings that you can exploit.
*   **Ignoring customer needs and market trends** – Staying static can lead to rapid decline if competitors act faster. Remember that customer preferences and standards shift over time, and your SMB GTM strategy should factor that in.

In most cases, you can quickly adjust your GTM so long as you don’t overcommit your resources (that’s why you budget! 🙂) and stay agile enough to pivot when you run into a problem.
