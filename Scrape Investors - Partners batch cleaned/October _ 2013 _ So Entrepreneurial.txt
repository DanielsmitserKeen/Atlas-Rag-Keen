# October | 2013 | So Entrepreneurial

You might wonder who inspires me as an entrepreneur and a writer.

There are many, but one person is Mark Suster.  He is a previous two time entrepreneur – sold his last company to Salesforce – and is now an investor and has been with with Upfront Ventures for about 6 or 7 years.

He’s great because he views startups from both the investor AND the founder perspectives, hence he writes at [Both Sides Of The Table.](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/)   His straightforward tone and no BS attitude is something I have taken to my own words.  Like him I feel truth, honesty and controversial topics should be embraced by an influencer.  Ya’ll deserve it.

To get an idea of who Mark is, here’s a recent interview with Sarah Lacy of PandoDaily.

If you are an entrepreneur I suggest sitting back and taking some notes.  It’s long, but chock full of gems.

So, you want to start a company?

Awesome.  That’s a very exciting decision but first you must make sure it’s the _right_ decision.

Startups are hard and have been referred to as “a full contact sport” by others so deciding to be a founder is only the right decision if you are ready and willing to except what comes with founding a startup.

Coincidently I am going through this same thinking process right now.  Even though I have started a few companies before, I find myself at the starting line once again evaluating a new “dent in the universe” idea with a fellow co-founder.  Here are five questions I am asking myself right now to help determine if it’s the _right_ decision.  I believe they can that help you too along your path to starting your next company.

**[![thinking-man](https://soentrepreneurial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/thinking-man.jpg?w=222&h=300)](https://soentrepreneurial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/thinking-man.jpg)Am I really an Entrepreneur?**

Risk is the heart of entrepreneurship — which is [defined](http://www.inc.com/eric-schurenberg/the-best-definition-of-entepreneurship.html?usrid=47067%3Fnav%3Dlinkedin) as “the pursuit of opportunity _without regard_ to resources currently controlled.” Your relationship with risk is the sole determinant whether you will succeed or fail as an entrepreneur.

Are you ready to take a risk?  I encourage you to think of yourself as an entrepreneur in the adjective form, not a verb.  What do I mean?  Well, during my first startup I struggled – a lot, and for a long time – and it really bothered me because I didn’t really know why I was struggling.

Then it finally hit me.

It all changed when I re-thought what the dream actually was.  I realized my dream wasn’t about what I was working on at the time, but more about the person I was becoming in the process.  The dream is about being an entrepreneur – the adjective – not the noun.

> Entrepreneur – noun.  _A proprietor who owns their own business.  A title._
> 
> Entrepreneur – adjective.  _A person who embodies the qualities of being_ _Courageous. Risk Taker.  Innovative.  Persistent.  Agile.  Intelligent.  Savvy. Strong.  Personable.  Creative.  Excellent. Fighter.  Winner._ 

Once I realized all I needed to do is change me perspective of who I was, everything changed.  Also, I realize being an entrepreneur was all about how I viewed and embraced the world of risk.

Fellow entrepreneur and billionaire [Sir Richard Branson](http://www.amazon.com/Losing-My-Virginity-Survived-Business/dp/0307720748/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1326912286&sr=8-3) follows a principle called “protecting the downside,” which means that by looking at any situation and determining all options before making a decision, one can identify the worst case scenario and work backwards from there to find the optimal route forward. Protecting the downside is really just identifying and understanding risk.

So your first step is all about asking if you can handle a world full of risk.

**Am I ready?**

Once you determine you are cut from the entrepreneurial cloth, you must ask yourself if you are actually ready.  Is it the right time to embrace a life of high risk and high reward?

Question yourself on things like: Do I have more important responsibilities, such as family obligations, debt to repay, volunteer work, coaching youth sports, or things that require your time and energy?

The reality is startups take pretty much all of your time and energy.  They are like rockets going to space – it takes A LOT of energy to take off but based on physics it takes less energy to keep going as it gets higher and farther away from earth.

Step 2:  sideline some of these major responsibilities if you are to start a high growth company, and  then pick them back up once things really get going.

**Am I passionate about the idea?**

Once the commitment has been made and you believe you are ready to take the plunge, you should ask if this is something you are really interested in, passionate about, and willing to give it 5-10 years of your life.

This is somewhat of a controversial topic.  Some say founders need not be passionate about a startup, simply because only possessing passion for a subject does not guarantee success.  And I agree.  Just being fanatic and uber-excited about something is not a shoe-in for startup success.  But consider the opposite: if a person is not particularly interested in a subject and not emotionally driven to solve a particular problem in the world, will they be able to make it through the [trough of sorrow?](http://blog.tetuanvalley.com/2011/11/beware-the-trough-of-sorrow.html)

I think not.

Step 3 requires asking yourself if you posses energy, curiosity and passion about what you are doing so you can withstand the inevitable challenges and be able to push through the hardships you will face.

**Is it a big and growing market?**

Startup fact: Investors are looking for home runs, not singles.

One of the biggest mistakes first time founders make is not evaluating markets correctly and picking a market with low potential for growth.  Most investors and potential acquirers evaluate startups on the recipe of future potential.  A founder who desires a successful outcome for their company should look for _solutions to problems in growing markets_.

What is a growing market?

Growing markets are ones with an accelerating rate of competitors, users, revenue potential, and aligned with emerging technologies/platforms.   Founders should build their solution with forward thinking perspectives on technology and societal norms.  (ie: mobile usage vs desktop usage,  network platforms vs non viral sites, portable vs non portable tech, etc…)

Even if a founder is not planning to accept outside investment and wants grow from a bootstrapped position, it still makes sense to look for market that is big and growing.

Step 4 requires one to ask themselves, “_no matter the size of my ambition, am I building for tomorrow, not just today?_”

**What are my unique gifts?**

Startups are difficult and require one to utilize their unique talents and gift in ways they may have never imagined before.  When a founder starts their company, it’s important they take some time and take into account their naturally gifts.  Are you uniquely technical and have the ability to quickly whip together a simple prototype?  Or are you more social, amazing with people, a natural salesman and can easily work a room full of investors?  Are you a visionary or an operations person?

This is probably the hardest question of the bunch, but the most important because the answer to these questions will point to your next phase of the company – recruiting others.  If you are non-technical and (most likely) better with leading people, you will need to find a technical person to balance your founding team out and help you build products.   If you are highly technical and can easily hack together websites and mobile apps, you will need to find someone who is less technical but more gifted in the business and people operations.

The last step pulls you inward to understand yourself, what your talents are, and who you should look to bring on and join you in your new venture.

Asking yourself these 5 tough questions should not only help determine if this decision is a good one, but if it is the _right_ one for you at this time.

[LIFFFT](https://www.liffft.com/), an awesome startup here in Seattle, has put together a great presentation on everything you need to know about conducting customer interviews.

Discovering your customers and the exact problems they face is something you, as a founder, cannot predict.  So you must go and talk to them directly.  Here’s how you do it.

In a recent [Founders RAW](http://www.foundersraw.com/full-conversations/) conversation I spoke with a good friend and fellow founder Cameron Wheeler.

You may be familiar with Cameron and his company as I [covered his startup ZappBug](https://soentrepreneurial.com/2013/02/05/zappbug-dissected-the-crazy-story-about-turning-bed-bugs-into-a-killer-business/) earlier this year.  Yes, they manufacture ovens to [kill bedbugs](http://www.zappbug.com/):

“_The idea was to develop a bed bug oven that could use heat to kill bed bugs in luggage and other personal belongings, saving peoples belongings in the end. “We chose to begin with this product because we had the technical competency to do it. Heat treatment is a proven way to kill bed bugs. The product could be used for both prevention and extermination and would be a great revenue generator.”_

 Although Cameron is a good friend of mine, I have to say I am very impressed with him and believe he’ll be extremely successful as an entrepreneur.  In my opinion he just “has it” and you definitely sense it when you sit and chat with him.

What’s “it” you say?

A deadly combination of: Smarts.  Intelligence.  Technical know how.  Social intelligence.  Persistence.  Understanding of markets.  Knowing where to innovate.  Youth.

Go ahead and watch the conversation.  From meeting Elon Musk to spending time in China, it’s a fascinating conversation.

I remember it was a rainy, cold and downright depressing winter day in Seattle. The gray skies, piecing wind and nasty looks on people’s faces didn’t help what I was dealing with at all.

That was the day I realized I didn’t know what to do.

I had worked my ass off for almost 2 years on my mobile payment startup Seconds, but too no avail.   The writing was on the wall.  Yes, we had customers and yes we even had revenue.  But no, we weren’t growing and no we weren’t able to raise money to continue forward as a team.

The thing was I didn’t know what to do.

Do I simply shut it down completely?  Quit cold-Turkey?  What about our existing customers?  What about our reputations?  What would others think if we “failed” at our startup?

I was also broke.

I had gone 15 months without pay, barely living off credit cards and other things I scrambled together.  It was terrible.  Some days I didn’t have enough money to eat.  Some days I struggled to buy a ferry ticket home and so I slept on a floor in the office.  I was riding the ferry to and from the office each day because I had no way to pay rent,  so I chose to stay with my sister and her family – an hour and half away across the sound from Seattle.   Graciously, my family and friends helped out when they could which to this day I am ever grateful.

I was definitely worried for myself, not “OMG will I ever be successful” worry but more like “holy crap, I am really on a sinking ship here.”

I didn’t want to admit I needed to jump ship before it sank, I wanted to ignore the holes and guide it to smooth waters.  Why?  Because that’s what “winners” do, right?  But I knew the holes needed patching, and meant getting another job.   I just couldn’t admit to myself the dream was over.

But I just didn’t know what to do.   Then it finally hit me.

It all changed when I re-thought what the dream actually was.  I realized my dream wasn’t about what I was working on at the time, but more about the person I was becoming in the process.  The dream is about being an entrepreneur – the adjective – not the noun.

> Entrepreneur – noun.  _A proprietor who owns their own business.  A title._
> 
> Entrepreneur – adjective.  _A person who embodies the qualities of being_ _Courageous. Innovative.  Persistent.  Agile.  Intelligent.  Savvy. Strong.  Personable.  Creative.  Excellent. Fighter.  Winner._ 

Once I realized all I needed to do is change the horizon I was gazing towards, everything changed.  I removed myself from the echo-chamber of my head and finally understood, “YIKES, YES THIS BOAT IS SINKING AND I NEED TO GET OFF!”

So I jumped out, found something part time that would plug the hole (support me finically) and was able to live another day.  I started to understand entrepreneurship is a life-long game and to win you need to embody the adjectives, not the nouns.  Once I took that heavy financial burden off my shoulders everything started to get better, my head got clearer and my smile got wider.

I got my mojo back.

Being an entrepreneur is not a title, it’s a person.  Or a persona.   Or a set of characteristics that allow you to dig out of any shitty situation you’ll inevitably find yourself in.

When I found myself in a situation where I didn’t know what to do I simply changed my mindset, which allowed me to see the world in new ways.   Sometimes simply looking at things from a different perspective is all it takes to change your own world.

[![6a00d8341c03bb53ef014e606f4675970c-800wi](https://soentrepreneurial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/6a00d8341c03bb53ef014e606f4675970c-800wi.jpg?w=300&h=240)](https://soentrepreneurial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/6a00d8341c03bb53ef014e606f4675970c-800wi.jpg)I was recently asked my thoughts on how to approach pricing digital products aimed at the local Small and Medium Business.

Actually, the exact question was:

_Basically, I’m looking at how new startups decide on a pricing structure when they’re selling to SMBs. Essentially, you’ve got your product/platform/system, and you’ve pinpointed your target customers—now how do you determine how much to charge? Obviously market research is important, but what specific recommendations do you have in terms of how to pinpoint the right pricing for a new digital marketing/hyperlocal platform?_ 

My answer:

Pricing is a tricky thing.  Price too high and you put yourself out of business because no customers will pay that high of price for your product.  Price too low, and you run the risk of giving away too much for free and struggle to keep the doors open – again possibly going out of business. Digital or not, a startup needs to be able balance the need to generate revenue with the opportunity to attract as many customers as possible.

I think it comes down to doing a few key things really early on.  First, study the current market to determine who is offering what and at what price points.  You should be able to look at the market and see the high end/low end products and their associated prices.  You then look for the holes in the market – where’s the point where customers are paying too much for not enough value?  That’s where you can bring something highly valuable to the table at a more affordable price and undercut the market.

Second, it’s really important to determine what problems you are solving and what value you are actually providing.  If it’s just the same as others on the market then it will become a price war with competitors – which you probably don’t want since it usually is a race to zero.  Ask yourself how can you do something new and innovative that hasn’t been done before, and then you’ll have more freedom on the pricing structure.  McLean Reiter, CEO of hyperlocal startup Knotis, echo’s my thoughts.  He says “_Most SMBs have less than $1,000 to spend on marketing, annually, so it needs to be affordable and if possible, monthly, to help them manage their cash flow better. So_ _It all comes back to value – what do they get in exchange for what they are paying for. You need to price yourself according to the market and your overall objective, while also maintaining profitability._

Lastly, it’s truly impossible to determine your exact prices before you go to market and interact with customers.  Smart entrepreneurs engage with their customers early on, ask them about price points and adjust/iterate as they continue forward.  Founders should also use these customer interactions to uncover the hidden needs of customers, which becomes the real value of your product and thus helping to determine a pricing model.  People pay higher prices for things they really need and can’t get elsewhere.  And ultimately, companies should A/B test certain price points (offer variable pricing to random customers through marketing and study the results) to see which convert better and then optimize from there.  

 Pricing can be tricky.  So agree to understand you will not know what your pricing will be out of the gate, you will only learn what it should be over time.

Fall 2013 will be looked back on as the turning point in fundraising for early stage startups.   The JOBS Act, along with the acceptance of  “General Solicitation” has indeed changed the game for founders looking for startup capital.

Although changes in government regulation will have an impact on startup funding, I believe the biggest impact will come from innovations in the private sector – more specifically the Seed/Angel community.

[AngelList](https://soentrepreneurial.com/2013/10/angel.co) has emerged as a black swan in the investment community and is opening up funding channels founders never dreamed of even just a few short years ago.   It allows well known entrepreneurs, advisors, and angel investors a digital network to follow startup activity and quickly jump into investment deals with new hot companies.  This makes it quite a bit easier for startups to close a round of seed funding.   The days of hitting Sand Hill road in hopes of simply getting your project off the ground are over.

And more recently, AngelList announced a new feature called Syndicates, where Angels can basically become “leads” and pool capital from other Angels (or Syndicates) to quickly create their own mini-fund.  They then use this to deploy into early stage companies on AngelList, with the transaction happening all through the AngelList platform.

I will not dive into details of Syndicates, please [go here](https://angel.co/help/syndicates) if you want a full description of how it works.  I simply want to touch on where this is going and why AngelList’s innovations are game changing to the larger startup community, for better or for worse.

The big question is how will this affect founders and the overall startup community?  Is it all good?  Or will there be unforeseen consequences which inevitably come with drastic changes?

Since I am not the expert I looked around to others and researched their take on the changes happening with Syndicates.

The innovations around AngelList are clearly going to benefit founders – namely to speed up the fundraising process.  Mark Suster believes it’s a [net positive for the industry.](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2013/09/29/is-angellist-syndicates-really-such-a-big-deal/)  “_The most obvious, syndicates can move faster in early-stage deals than rounding up 40 individual investors.”_  Good, we don’t need to heard cattle as much anymore!

But what about for the angel investors?  Although it might be better deal flow, it seems market dynamics and economic factors are going to come into play on the investor side.  [Hunter Walk](http://hunterwalk.com/2013/09/28/angellist-syndicates-will-also-pit-angel-against-angel/) sees interesting changes coming for angels, “_My guess is there are also some angels who were popular when they represented a $25k check but won’t be as sought after if they try to push $300k into a round.”_  The nuances here are not obvious and only time will tell if this is good for the angel community or not.

 [Fred Wilson](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/09/leading-vs-following.html) also believes this is good for founders.  “_Angel List Syndicates are turning angels who have traditionally been followers into leads. That’s a good thing in many ways. The more folks who can lead a round, the better, at least for the entrepreneurs.”_   But he goes even further to describe how it will force the investment community to grow and work harder.  “_It also means that they will have to learn to lead and lead well. They will have to step up before anyone else does. They will have to negotiate price and terms. They will have to sit on boards. They will have to help get the next round done. Essentially they will have to work. That’s why they are getting carry from the syndicate, after all.”_

So maybe it’s too early to tell how AngelList will affect the ecosystem but questions loom.

Is this actually going to flatten the playing field for all of us founders looking for seed capital?  Or is it just going to make it even easier for “highly connected” founders to close a deal even quicker than before?  You only get discovered on AngelList if you can float to the top by “trending” on the network.   What does “trending” mean on AngelList?  And how do you achieve that if you are not in in the Bay Area, in 500 Startups or a part of YCombinator?  Is AngelList inevitably the web 2.0 version of the Old Boys Club?  Or is it the fundraising mecca all of us founders have dreamed of when we say to ourselves “if only we had access to more angel investors!”

We shall see!

In the end,  AngelList is a new beast and we don’t know what the effect will be on the industry as a whole but I am fascinated with the direction things are going.  My hope – easier access to angels and seed capital for all _qualified_ startups no matter their location.

In a recent Founders RAW conversation I asked Duxter founder Adam Lieb his thoughts on AngelList.

[![19_20120115feet-cliff032](https://soentrepreneurial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/19_20120115feet-cliff032.jpg?w=300&h=199)](https://soentrepreneurial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/19_20120115feet-cliff032.jpg)That statement emerged from a conversation I was having recently with a founder friend of mine.

This individual is struggling in their current situation – not far enough along to support themselves with their endeavor but not wanting to let go (if only slightly) to do other work which would pay the bills.   They said it feels like being between a rock and a hard place, and it’s painful.  I felt it was more like a cliff.

I simply said:  _“Great Founders Learn To Toe The Edge Without Falling Off The Cliff “_

I know this spot really well because I was there for quite a while and I remember almost falling off more than a few times.

What I learned through the process was how to toe the line – balance on the edge if you will – without falling off the cliff.  I realized entrepreneurship is balancing the risk of great rewards with the risk of detrimental actions.

How do you know which is which and what to do when you find yourself getting weak knees as you get pushed towards the cliff?

You have to look deep inside yourself and ask “what do I gain from staying here?  Do I really only have one option, which is to stay here and not evaluate my other options?”

Notice I said “gain” not “lose”?  There’s a big difference between those two perspectives.  When you are standing on the edge looking far down the cliff, you have much to lose.  So much in fact it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what you are doing and why.  Founders face so much challenge and adversity they can easily lose their perspectives and clarity of thought.

I told my friend he needs to look inside and ask what he gains from staying there.  He needs to look out for himself first and foremost.  He needs to take care of his basic needs – be it money, food, shelter, stress relief, relationships – and only them will the company stuff  work itself out.

I said, “trust me, it won’t get any better if you don’t step away from the ledge.”

Stepping away from the ledge is exactly what I did and I am so much better for it.  Yes, I had to swallow the pill and realize my “first” attempt at building my company wasn’t going to end like I dreamed it would just a few short years ago.  But as I backed away from the ledge and got my priorities/basic needs back in order, things started happening I never thought possible.

You would be amazed what happens to your business life when you remove self inflicted pain and stress from your personal life.

As founders sometimes we dive so far into our own product we get lost, making everything more difficult than it needs to be.  It doesn’t have to be that way.

In a recent [Founders RAW conversation](http://www.foundersraw.com/adam-lieb-find-problems-create-solutions-scale-quickly/) I sat down with Adam Lieb, founder of gaming social network Duxter.  Early on in the conversation he brought up something I thought was interesting.

Wait…  Not interesting.  Actually, it was genius.

He basically said “find a problem, create a solution, and scale quickly.  It’s that simple.”

Wow, you would think we all figure that out.  But unfortunately we don’t.

What happens is we tend to 1) under-think the problem by not taking the time to talk to the target customer, thus missing the opportunity;  2) over-think the solution we provide and convolute our concept to the point of confusion; or 3) under-think the solution by simply copying another company.

Any way you slice it, the tendency for founders to veer off course is easy and happens often.  I call what Adam said genius because I am now convinced the real geniuses in our world are the ones that can take something complex and turn it into something simple for the masses to grasp.  People part with money only for things they understand.  Everything else, to the laymen, is gibberish.

From what I gathered during my conversation with Adam, he has seemingly nailed it with Duxter.  They do a ton of customer development.  They listen to what those customers are saying.  They then zeroed in on a problem, created a simple solution and then worked to scale it quickly.

Remember founders, it doesn’t have to be that complicated.

You can find more short clips of useful conversations at [Founders RAW](http://foundersraw.com/).

Should you work on more than one project/company at a time?

Is it good to wear numerous hats at once?

These are the thoughts bouncing around my head right now as I evaluate what comes next for me.  Many of you know I have a number of things going on right now – from Seconds (mobile payments) to Callin’it (the sports prediction app) to Founders RAW to my writing and to other startup ideas I have.  This doesn’t even include the work I do on a weekly basis to keep a consistent income and pay the bills.

It’s good then that I finally figured out a time structure that works for me.  Basically, just get the #^$% done is how I operate.  It doesn’t matter if it takes 30 mins or 10 hours, I just need to get the deliverables – delivered.

And it’s working.

The point of this post – and the questions I opened with – is  I think doing more than just “one thing” at a time works.  For some of us.  I recently noticed myself bouncing from one thing to another after short bursts of energy given to a particular project/company.

It seems to work for me and my personality.

Similar to a workout, I give high intensity attention the particular activity for a short time and then move on to the next thing during the day that needs attention.  During a typical day I might work on 2 or 3 different companies/projects/products but in the aggregate it seems to work.

It’s refreshing to move onto a totally different company and project right after completing a task with the first one.  For me, it means progress since I am starting to see the exponential impact these projects are having on my life.

And it’s a hell of a step in the right direction after the challenging year I had last year, where I felt stuck in the mud.

This might not be sustainable long term, as in trying to run the next big company I decide to start.  Once you have  structure, employees, and a more natural cadence to the daily efforts of the company some of my side projects might need to cool down for a while.

Then again, Virgin Group founder and billionaire Richard Branson pretty much lives the exact lifestyle I am describing above.  So I think the lesson is in finding the right cadence and level of appropriate ADD that allows you to maximize effectiveness in as many things as possible.

If that’s just one thing – great.   If it’s many, you are probably one of the few.

We started Founders RAW a few months ago and are almost to our 10th full conversation with entrepreneurs here in Seattle.   For those who aren’t aware, Founders RAW is a new multimedia property where we showcase videos of casual conversations with other startup founders.  When I realized I was having great conversations with my founder friends at local startup events I decided we need to record this stuff and push it out to others.  Maybe you can learn something as well.

Check it out for yourself >  [Founders RAW](http://www.foundersraw.com/).

I typically sit down with one person each week, grab a beer and dive deep into what it’s like to start a company.  One of the big things I have taken away thus far is how patterns emerge during these conversations.

[![Founders RAW behind scenes](https://soentrepreneurial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/founders-raw-behind-scenes.jpg?w=630&h=471)](https://soentrepreneurial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/founders-raw-behind-scenes.jpg)

Sitting with Simon Crosby during our Founders RAW conversation at the WTIA TechNW event in Seattle.

What do I mean by patterns?

By patterns I mean in how these founders identify the challenges they face and how they dealt with and overcame them.  Not to say all entrepreneurs experience the same things, but as I peer deeper into my conversations and read between the lines, certain characteristics or principles seem to be emerging.

The founders also seem to allude to similar experiences of company near-death and despair – yet they continued forward when all seemed lost.  So yes, no one is immune to the inevitable challenges and tough times ahead.

Sitting with Carlos Guestrin during our conversation at the WTIA TechNW event in Seattle.

**Vision**

Each founder I talk with embodies a strong sense of vision – they know where they are going and what they want to accomplish.  Vision is what sets them apart from their competition and allows them to navigate changing waters when their market matures and shifts with the times.  John Cook had a vision of digital media even when he was working  as a reporter for a traditional newspaper.  Amazingly, he pitched them on rolling out a whole new concept involving the web and digital properties, only to be shot down my management.  So he left and started it himself!

We know now who had the vision and who was stuck in the past.

**Strength**

The founders I have spent time with all have the quality of strength, meaning they are able to endure and deal with the challenges ever-present in entrepreneurship.   Whether it be dealing with co-founder issues, standing up to advisors and investors when their business model is challenged, or when push comes to shove they determine to out innovate the competition.  Adam Lieb, founder of gaming social network Duxter, displayed a strong sense of character as he detailed out his experience raising money from angel investors.  It’s not easy for startup founders to raise money, especially here in Seattle vs down in the Valley.   The lesson I took was investors want to invest in strong, vision oriented founders, not weak leaders who will bend at any sense of difficulty.

**Flexibility**

Lastly, as market forces change the tech landscape founders must be flexible and change with it.  Advancements in technology are only speeding up and drastically influencing how we build our companies.  Just a handful of years ago AWS/Amazon was nowhere to be seen.  Now, because startups can now host in the cloud using services like AWS and Heroku, startup costs have dropped dramatically and thus have allowed a founder to launch a company in under $5K initial investment.   Bob Crimmins made a huge point regarding this as he spoke about what he is seeing with the TechStars companies he mentors.  “They act quickly, test frequently and iterate often.”  That is why the successful ones are growing – the lowered cost to start and grow has allowed for more/quicker iterations of web products and services.

It’s been fun thus far and I can’t wait to see what happens next.  And I think you should do this too!  No, you don’t have to record your conversations like we are but I think Mark Suster was onto something when he says you should take [50 coffee meetings](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CC0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bothsidesofthetable.com%2F2011%2F08%2F15%2Fwhy-you-need-to-take-50-coffee-meetings%2F&ei=RglLUqzUGsG7qgHemIDQCg&usg=AFQjCNERGtkbsxezD2-oc66EElaFUUyXkg&sig2=aN_UXW17iFzevmFB_5rnOA&bvm=bv.53371865,d.aWM) this next year.
