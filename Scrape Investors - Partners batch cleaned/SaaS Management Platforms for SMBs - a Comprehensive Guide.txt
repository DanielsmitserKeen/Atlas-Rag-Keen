## What is a SaaS Management Platform? 

In today's fast-evolving business landscape, where digital transformation is no longer a buzzword but a necessity, the reliance on Software as a Service (SaaS) applications has grown exponentially. These cloud-based applications bring unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and efficiency to companies of all sizes. However, as the number of SaaS applications being utilized by Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) surges, a new challenge arises: effectively managing this increasingly complex SaaS ecosystem.

This is where SMPs, or Saas Operations Management Platforms as they are also called, come into play. Picture them as the cockpit of a plane – a centralized control center where all critical information, insights, and actions related to an organization's SaaS applications converge. These platforms serve as a guiding compass, helping you to navigate the intricate SaaS landscape with precision and ease.

![SaaS Management Platform- definition](https://www.substly.com/hs-fs/hubfs/kOsEizJ8jKs%20(3)%20(1).png?width=500&height=488&name=kOsEizJ8jKs%20(3)%20(1).png)

At its core, a SaaS Management tool is designed to provide you with a comprehensive, holistic view of the entire SaaS ecosystem. This means easy access to a unified interface that offers insights into all the applications in use instead of grappling with scattered information and multiple dashboards. This visibility is invaluable; it allows you to pinpoint trends, uncover inefficiencies, and make informed decisions.

In a nutshell, SMPs are the glue that binds your SaaS ecosystem together. They offer a bird's-eye view of applications, enable efficient cost management and vendor management enhance security and compliance, automate workflows, and provide invaluable insights for strategic decision-making. For navigating the complex realm of the modern business environment, these platforms are the compass that ensures you stay on course toward growth and success. 

## Benefits of a SaaS Management Strategy and Platforms

Adopting a [SaaS management strategy](https://www.substly.com/en/blog/what-is-saas-management) and platform yields many benefits contributing to your company's overall growth and stability.

Cost Savings are among the most tangible advantages. SMBs often find themselves juggling a multitude of subscriptions with varying pricing structures from different SaaS vendors. It's easy to lose track and end up overpaying for unused licenses. The ability to track application usage and identify underutilized or redundant subscriptions leads to substantial savings. SMBs often find themselves overpaying for licenses that are no longer essential. With a SaaS operations management platform, these inefficiencies are exposed and rectified, resulting in a leaner and more cost-effective software stack.

Enhanced Productivity is another goal of SaaS management. Without a centralized system, users struggle to locate the right applications or deal with access issues. This leads to precious time being wasted. A management platform ensures the right tools are readily accessible, enabling employees to focus on tasks that drive your business practices forward.

In the realm of Security, SaaS governance is a shield you can wield. In an era where data breaches can be catastrophic for companies financially and reputationally, having a system of record is crucial. SaaS management tools enable you to enforce security policies, keep sensitive data safe, and ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR or ISO. This proactive stance minimizes the risk of data breaches and the resulting damage to reputation and finances.

Managing user access and permissions across multiple applications from various SaaS vendors is a notorious pain point. Mundane and time-consuming tasks, such as provisioning licenses and managing approval processes, are streamlined, freeing up valuable human resources for more strategic endeavors than SaaS license management.

Streamlined On- and Offboarding is an HR-related benefit that these platforms bring to the table. Onboarding new staff members involves provisioning accounts for various applications, which is time-consuming and error-prone when done manually. SaaS operations management platforms ensure that new hires have the necessary tools from day one, enhancing their motivation, productivity, and integration into the team. Conversely, when people leave, their access can be promptly revoked, minimizing potential security risks. 

SMBs operating in regulated industries face the ongoing challenge of maintaining Regulatory Compliance. Non-compliance can result in severe penalties. SaaS operations management platforms simplify compliance efforts by providing audit trails, tracking application usage, and ensuring that all software aligns with industry standards.

The power of Informed Decision-Making should not be underestimated. SaaS management tools provide actionable insights through data analytics. These insights empower you to make well-informed decisions about application usage, licensing, and vendor relationships. This data-driven approach enhances business strategies, helping you stay agile in a dynamic market.

## Key Features of SMPs

The key features embedded in SaaS Management Platforms further amplify the above-mentioned benefits, creating a powerful toolkit that revolutionizes managing your SaaS ecosystem by becoming your strategic partner in a rapidly evolving business landscape.

One of the primary functionalities of these platforms is **Application Visibility and Tracking**. Imagine having a system of record that tracks application usage. After deploying SaaS tools, you can identify which are frequently utilized and which are collecting digital dust. This feature alone empowers you to identify redundant tools and those with low adoption rates. You can optimize your software portfolio and trim unnecessary expenses by pinpointing no longer essential applications.

**Cost Optimization** is a key driver for SMBs adopting these platforms. By monitoring subscription usage, these tools show which licenses to scale down or discontinue. This proactive approach to cost management empowers you to maximize your budget and invest strategically in applications that genuinely contribute to growth.

One of the challenges in a multi-SaaS environment is managing **User Access and Permissions**. SaaS operations management platforms simplify this by centralizing user management. Administrators can streamline the onboarding process for new employees, ensuring they have access to the necessary applications from day one. Similarly, access can be revoked swiftly when people leave, mitigating potential security risks.

**Security and Compliance** form the foundation of any robust SaaS ecosystem. SMPs bolster these aspects by enforcing security policies and offering compliance tracking features. With data breaches becoming increasingly common, maintaining stringent security measures is non-negotiable. [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3996830) states, "Organizations that fail to manage SaaS life cycles centrally will remain five times more susceptible to a cyber incident or data loss."

**Automation** is another noteworthy feature. Many SaaS operations management platforms facilitate workflows for tasks such as provisioning licenses, managing approvals, and handling employee transitions. This reduces manual effort and ensures consistency in processes, reducing the chances of errors that can lead to security vulnerabilities.

Moreover, these platforms offer **Integration and Analytics** capabilities. Integration with other tools ensures data flow between applications. This cross-platform connectivity enhances efficiency,  provides a more unified user experience, and simplifies vendor management. The analytics component furnishes you with insights into usage patterns, helping you make informed decisions about application investments and potential optimizations.

## When Should a SMB Invest in a SaaS Management Platform?

Several scenarios indicate it is time to up your SaaS governance game and consider investing in an SMP.

[![6 signs you need a SaaS management platform](https://www.substly.com/hs-fs/hubfs/6%20signs%20you%20need%20a%20SaaS%20management%20platform%20(4).jpg?width=400&height=1000&name=6%20signs%20you%20need%20a%20SaaS%20management%20platform%20(4).jpg)](https://www.substly.com/hubfs/6%20signs%20you%20need%20a%20SaaS%20management%20platform%20\(5\).jpg)

**Rapid Growth** often signifies the need for such a platform. As your operations expand, the number of SaaS applications quickly increases and becomes overwhelming. Managing them individually becomes impractical. A management platform provides a centralized solution that can scale along with your growth.

**SaaS spend visibility** has become a concern. Particularly when software costs start to escalate due to unused subscriptions and inefficient purchasing practices, implementing a SaaS operations management platform can rein in these expenses by identifying redundant subscriptions and give you insights into negotiating better deals.

Operating in an industry dealing with sensitive customer information or regulatory requirements leads to **Data Security Concerns** that are a significant driver. A management platform ensures that security policies are enforced consistently across all SaaS applications, minimizing the risk of data breaches.

When **Enhanced Productivity** is sought, a SaaS management tool will help. Employees wasting time navigating numerous applications can be detrimental to efficiency. A management platform streamlines workflows, ensuring employees spend more time on meaningful tasks and less on application management.

Small organizations with **Limited IT Resources** stand to benefit significantly from an SMP. These platforms' simplified administration allows small teams to manage a complex SaaS landscape effectively.

A SaaS management tool simplifies compliance efforts in industries with strict **Audit and Reporting** demands. The platform provides accurate records of application usage, making audits less cumbersome and reducing the risk of compliance violations.

## Challenges of Implementing a SMP

While the benefits are substantial, implementing a SaaS management tool can present a few challenges you must be aware of and prepared for.

### Initial Setup Complexity

Initial Setup Complexity is a hurdle that you might encounter. Integrating existing SaaS applications into the management platform requires careful planning and coordination. Depending on the applications' diversity and underlying infrastructure, this process might demand time and effort.

### User Adoption

User Adoption can also be a stumbling block. Staff accustomed to their current workflows might initially resist changes brought about by a new management platform. Clear communication about the benefits and training sessions will help mitigate this resistance and accelerate user adoption.

### Integration Issues

Integration issues might arise, especially when deploying SaaS tools that lack robust APIs or compatibility. Ensuring smooth integration between the management platform and various SaaS applications is one of the main challenges and requires technical expertise and custom solutions.

### Dedicating Resources and Ongoing Maintenance 

Dedicating Resources and Ongoing Maintenance are essential for the longevity of the management platform's effectiveness. Regular updates, license tracking, and user access management need consistent attention. Neglecting these tasks could lead to inaccurate insights, security vulnerabilities, and missed optimization opportunities.

## Differences between SMPs for Small Businesses and Enterprises

When it comes to SMPs, one size doesn't fit all. Smaller companies' needs, complexities, and scale are distinct from those of larger enterprises. As a result, SaaS management tools are often tailored to cater to the unique requirements of these two categories. Let's explore the key differences between platforms targeting SMBs and those catering to larger enterprises:

### SaaS Scale and Complexity

**SMBs:** SaaS management platforms designed for SMBs tend to be more straightforward and user-friendly, focusing on essential features such as cost optimization, basic security enforcement, and ease of integration.

## The 6-Step SMP Selection Process 

Investing in a SaaS operations management platform is a strategic decision for any company and requires careful consideration and research. With a plethora of options available in the market, it's essential to navigate the selection process thoughtfully to find the platform that aligns with your needs.

Here's a six steps best practice approach to guide you in finding and evaluating the best solution for your small or mid-sized company.

[![6 steps of a SaaS Management buying process - Infographic](https://www.substly.com/hs-fs/hubfs/6%20steps%20of%20a%20SaaS%20Management%20buying%20process%20-%20Infographic.jpg?width=800&height=2000&name=6%20steps%20of%20a%20SaaS%20Management%20buying%20process%20-%20Infographic.jpg)](https://www.substly.com/hubfs/Neutral%20Green%20Beige%20Simple%20Product%20Launch%20Process%20Infographic.jpg)
