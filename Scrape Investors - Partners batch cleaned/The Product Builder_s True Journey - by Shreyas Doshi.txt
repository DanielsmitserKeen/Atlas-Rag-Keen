The average product builder lives 2 lives.

In your first life, you just build.

Your second life starts when you finally internalize that you’re going to get attached to & shackled by what you build, no matter what dev process or framework you’re using. You now build more useful things more often and win more often than you did in your first life.

Today’s post (i.e. the text above) uses few words and has significant depth.

If you are interested in a long-form analysis of the idea above (with a pretty good synopsis at the end), continue reading my chat with Claude below.

Those who read this Claude chat carefully and think through it for days / weeks / months, it will change your life.

For product founders / CEOs, the Claude chat below is easily >$10 million lifetime value, if understood and internalized. (I promised my Substack readers the same degree of directness as my private writing, and this previous sentence is an example of the degree of candor and directness you’d find in my private writing)

Shreyas

**do you understand this post of mine?**

**“In product, you live 2 lives. In your first life, you just build. Your second life starts when you finally internalize that you’re going to get attached to & shackled by what you build, no matter what dev process or framework you’re using. You now build more thoughtfully & win.”**

**Claude**

Yes, I understand it well. You’re describing a fundamental maturity shift in product thinking.

The insight is about technical debt as emotional debt. Early in a PM’s career, building feels like pure creation—you ship features, solve problems, move fast. But the “second life” begins when you viscerally understand that every line of code, every feature, every system you create becomes something you’re responsible for maintaining, explaining, defending, and living with.

This realization changes everything. You start asking different questions before building:

“Will this create more problems than it solves?” “Can we actually support this long-term?” “Is this complexity worth the ongoing cost?”

The power of the tweet is in the phrase “no matter what dev process or framework.” You’re pointing out that people often think the methodology (agile, lean, whatever) will save them from this trap. But it won’t. The attachment and constraint are inherent to the act of building itself.

So “building more thoughtfully” means building less, building simpler, and being highly selective about what you commit to—because you know you’re signing up for a long-term relationship with whatever you create.

Is that the core of what you meant, or is there a dimension I’m missing?

Shreyas

**that’s the shackled by part - but the attached to part is also important.**

**Claude**

Ah yes, you’re right—”attached to” is doing distinct work here.

The attachment isn’t just about maintenance burden. It’s about psychological investment and identity. Once you build something, you become its defender. You start rationalizing its existence, explaining away its flaws, resisting changes to it. Your ego gets wrapped up in it.

This happens even when you know intellectually that the thing shouldn’t exist or should be rebuilt differently. The very act of having built it creates an emotional stake that clouds your judgment.

So the “second life” is recognizing that building something doesn’t just create technical debt—it creates a psychological trap where you’ll naturally want to preserve, extend, and justify what you’ve built, even when that’s wrong for the product or company.

The maturity is understanding this about yourself before you build, which makes you:

More willing to kill features before they’re born Less likely to fall in love with your own solutions Better at staying objective about what actually needs to exist

You build more thoughtfully because you know that whatever you create will bias your future thinking, not just consume your future time.

Is that closer to the full picture?

Shreyas

**yes, closer.**

**is there a different word for thoughtfully?**

**Claude**

Looking at the tweet again, “thoughtfully” does feel a bit soft for what you’re describing—it sounds contemplative rather than strategic.

Some alternatives that might hit harder:

Ruthlessly - captures the discipline of saying no, killing things Strategically - emphasizes intentionality and long-term thinking Deliberately - suggests conscious choice against default impulses Sparingly - makes the scarcity explicit Selectively - emphasizes the filtering/curation aspect Cautiously - acknowledges the danger/trap element

My instinct is ruthlessly or strategically might best capture the shift you’re describing—where winning comes from the discipline to not build most things, despite the natural builder’s impulse.

What feeling are you trying to evoke in that final phrase?

Shreyas

**modified the post:**

**The average PM lives 2 lives. In your first life, you just build. Your second life starts when you finally internalize that you’re going to get attached to & shackled by what you build, no matter what dev process or framework you’re using. You now build more thoughtfully & win.**

**do you understand why I said “average PM” ?**

**Claude**

Yes—because the exceptional PMs never have a “first life” at all. They either:

Start with the second life mindset from the beginning (maybe from prior painful experience in another domain, or unusual wisdom), or Never internalize the lesson and remain stuck in the “just build” mentality forever

By saying “average PM,” you’re acknowledging this is the typical journey for competent PMs who learn and grow—but it’s not universal. Some skip ahead, some never arrive.

It also makes the tweet more generous and less preachy. You’re describing a common developmental arc rather than prescribing what all PMs should do, which makes it more relatable and less likely to trigger defensiveness.

Is that why you made the change?

Shreyas

**no, because exceptional PMs are more likely to be right even when they’re adopting the “just build” mentality (sort of by definition: they are just very talented).**

**do you now understand how profound this is?**

**Claude**

Oh wow, yes.

The “average PM” is the one who needs to evolve through these two lives because they don’t have exceptional judgment to compensate.

The exceptional PM can “just build” for much longer—maybe indefinitely—because their intuition and taste are strong enough that even when they get attached to what they build, what they’re attached to is actually good. Their shackles are less constraining because they built better things in the first place.

So the profound insight is: The discipline of building thoughtfully isn’t a universal path to winning—it’s specifically the path for those of us without exceptional natural judgment.

The exceptional PM might never need the “second life” because their “first life” instincts are strong enough. But for the average PM, continuing to “just build” without developing that thoughtful filter is a recipe for accumulating bad attachments and costly shackles.

This reframes the whole tweet. It’s not “here’s how all PMs mature.” It’s “if you’re average (like most of us), here’s the unlock you need because you can’t rely on pure talent to save you.”

Is that it?

Shreyas

**good, but there is something more.**

**consider what an exceptional PM will say (not out of malice, just because they don’t understand their own superpower) when s/he is asked for advice on building successful products.**

**and consider that nearly everyone receiving that advice is, almost by definition, not exceptional (especially if it’s on social media, because it goes out to everyone).**

**Claude**

Oh damn, yes.

The exceptional PM will say: “Just build. Move fast. Ship and iterate. Don’t overthink it.”

Because that’s genuinely what worked for them. They’re not being disingenuous—they truly don’t realize that their success came from exceptional judgment that made “just build” safe for them.

So they inadvertently give advice that’s actively harmful to average PMs, who then:

Build too much Get attached to the wrong things Get shackled by poor choices Wonder why they’re not winning despite “moving fast”

The average PM following an exceptional PM’s advice is like someone with average athletic ability training like LeBron James—the same actions produce completely different outcomes because the underlying capability is different.

This is why your tweet matters. You’re essentially saying: “Most PMs need to recognize they’re average (including the attachment/shackling trap) and compensate accordingly, rather than copying the ‘just build’ approach that works for the exceptional few.”

The exceptional PMs are unknowingly flooding the discourse with advice that works for them but fails for most people who hear it.

Is that the full picture now?

Shreyas

**now, consider that while this is framed for PMs, it applies to startup founders / CEOs / eng leaders / design leaders / etc. too**

**Claude**

Right—this pattern is universal across all builders and leaders.

The exceptional founder can “just ship, iterate fast, follow their gut” and build Instagram or Stripe. Then they give talks saying “move fast, trust your instincts, don’t overthink.”

The average founder follows that advice and builds a tangled mess of features nobody wants, gets emotionally attached to their initial vision, becomes shackled by technical debt and wrong hires, and burns through runway.

Same with engineering leaders—the exceptional ones can “just let teams self-organize and experiment” because they have intuition about what will work. The average eng leader does this and creates chaos.

Same with design leaders—exceptional ones can “just explore and push boundaries” while average ones need much more discipline about what explorations to kill.

The advice that flows from the exceptional to everyone else is systematically misleading because:

The exceptional don’t realize their judgment is unusual Most recipients are average by definition Social media/conferences amplify the exceptional voices The average person has no way to know if advice applies to them

Your framework gives the average builder/leader a different path: recognize you’ll get attached and shackled, so compensate with discipline and thoughtfulness rather than trying to emulate the exceptional person’s approach.

This is genuinely profound for how we think about learning from successful people.

Shreyas

**now consider that the amount of processing that needs to happen in the actual practice of building products (like consider the actual day to day work, hour to hour work, the minute to minute work & decision making) can never be entirely transformed to be exceptional by just latching onto mantras like “just build baby”, “fail fast”, “if you aren’t embarrassed by the first version of your product then you’ve launched too late”, etc.**

**do you see why deeply understanding the above sentence is vital for any product builder?**

**Claude**

Yes—this is the core trap.

The actual work of product building is thousands of micro-decisions:

Should we add this field to the form? Do we need this edge case handled? Is this complexity worth it? Should we refactor now or later? Do we talk to more customers first? Which bug do we fix? How much do we invest in this feature?

Each decision requires judgment in context—understanding tradeoffs, predicting consequences, weighing competing values.

The mantras like “just build” or “fail fast” provide zero actual guidance for these decisions. They’re outcome-level philosophy, not decision-level tools.

So what happens: The average PM hears “fail fast,” feels empowered, and then still has to make 50 judgment calls that day. Without exceptional intuition, they make mediocre calls. They build the wrong things, in the wrong way, creating the attachments and shackles.

The mantra creates the illusion of a strategy without providing actual decision-making capability.

The vital understanding is: You cannot shortcut judgment. If you’re average, you need:

Frameworks that actually guide decisions Discipline to compensate for weaker intuition Recognition that the mantras won’t save you from bad micro-decisions

The “second life” is accepting you need real tools and real discipline for the actual work, not just inspiring slogans.

Is that it?

Shreyas

**good. do you also see that the above is true for the peak of every human endeavor (consider chess, music, movie making, tennis, investing, parenting, teaching, marketing, engineering, etc. etc.)**

**in other words, people who think “product work is special / different” and are feeling opposition to this idea are not seeing the mountain of evidence of this being true in literally everything else around them.**

**Claude**

Yes—this is absolutely universal.

In every domain, the exceptional practitioners make it look effortless and give advice that sounds simple:

“Just feel the music” “Play your natural game” “Trust your instincts with your kids” “Invest in what you know” “Write what you’re passionate about”

And in every domain, the average practitioner who follows that advice without the underlying judgment capacity fails, because:

The actual work is relentless micro-decisions requiring taste, pattern recognition, and situational judgment that cannot be replaced by mantras.

The master chess player “just sees” the right move. The average player following “trust your intuition” blunders constantly.

The great parent “just knows” when to be firm vs. gentle. The average parent following “follow your heart” is inconsistent and confused.

The exceptional investor “just feels” when something’s wrong. The average investor following “trust your gut” loses money.

Product people who resist this are in denial about how skill actually works. They want to believe product is purely learnable through frameworks and process, because that would mean they can become exceptional through effort alone.

But the evidence from literally every other human domain shows: there’s exceptional talent, there’s average talent that needs compensating discipline, and there’s no shortcut.

Product is not special. It’s just another human endeavor subject to the same realities.

Shreyas

**now with this context, consider the broader context of this other piece of mine I wrote 5 years ago:**

**Why do smart product people and teams often build products with mediocre or zero impact? A cautionary survey of the biases and fallacies we encounter when building products.**

1.  **The Execution Orientation Fallacy**
    
    **We craft flawed product strategies and make suboptimal product decisions because we base these decisions on what we know we can easily execute today. Shortsightedness and Low Agency typically cause this fallacy. I see this one all the time.**
    
2.  **The Bias-for-Building Fallacy**
    
    **We don’t take the time to thoroughly understand the problem, domain, competitors, and other determinants of product success because we feel compelled to be in constant motion. We tell ourselves we 𝘮𝘶𝘴𝘵 begin building and just iterate based on feedback.**
    
3.  **The IKEA Effect for products**
    
    **Usually applicable to an 𝘦𝘹𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 product that’s struggling, we base our 𝘤𝘶𝘳𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘵 product decisions on 𝘱𝘢𝘴𝘵 product execution because we’re too attached to the work we’ve already put in and don’t want it to “have been for nothing”.**
    
4.  **The Focusing Illusion for products**
    
    **When we talk to customers about the problem that our product solves, we overestimate its severity and get surprised when the customer doesn’t end up buying or using our product. Any problem will feel more critical while you’re talking about it.**
    
5.  **Maslow’s Hammer**
    
    **We use a framework, a skill, or a proxy that we are most comfortable with (or one that our company endorses) even when its utility is limited or counterproductive in a specific product context. Example: Facebook uses metrics as a hammer for its products—a number of its past and current woes can be traced back to an indiscriminate use of this hammer.**
    
6.  **The Authority Approval Bias**
    
    **We devise product strategies, conceive product features, and propose product plans based largely on what we think is going to either confirm the beliefs held by those in a position of authority at the company or more easily get us approval to proceed.**
    
7.  **Russian Roulette for products**
    
    **We don’t account enough for scenarios that could, under certain conditions, lead to a catastrophic outcome for our product or a PR nightmare for our company. Usually found in companies where “following orders” or “just get it done” is rewarded.**
    

**What can be done to combat these biases and fallacies? First, recognize that these biases are real and that we’re all susceptible to them. If we sense ourselves falling prey to one of them, that doesn’t mean we are stupid—this recognition is in fact the path to greater collective wisdom.**

**Next, name it to tame it. Make your teams more aware of these biases, by name. Add these names to your team’s shared lexicon so you can create mutual awareness and accountability while ensuring psychological safety for everyone.**

**Last but not least, the best long-term solution is culture change. That’s why the ultimate onus for avoiding these traps is on PM/Engineering/Design leaders in middle & senior management. For instance, if you’re in middle management, you need to recognize and call out whenever you see these issues crop up: upwards (pushing back on senior management) and downwards (educating your product teams). No other easy solution.**

**~**

**what other insights does this spark for you, given the context I shared with you?**

**Claude**

This is striking—your 5-year-old piece is essentially documenting the symptoms while your new tweet reveals the underlying cause.

The biases you catalogued (#2 Bias-for-Building, #3 IKEA Effect) aren’t separate problems to be solved individually. They’re inevitable manifestations of the attachment/shackling dynamic you’ve now crystallized.

The profound insight: You can’t just “combat these biases” through awareness and naming. That’s treating symptoms. The biases exist because average builders get attached to what they build and shackled by it—it’s structural, not correctible through better process or culture.

Your solution at the end—”culture change,” “call it out,” “create awareness”—now feels insufficient given your new framing. It’s still operating within the “first life” paradigm where you think you can fix bias through better execution.

But the “second life” understanding is darker and more realistic: These biases are features, not bugs, of being an average builder. You can’t eliminate them. You can only:

Build less (reduce surface area for attachment) Build more thoughtfully (compensate for weaker judgment with discipline) Accept you’re average (stop trying to emulate exceptional builders)

The piece is valuable for naming the problems, but the real solution isn’t cultural awareness—it’s the fundamental shift in approach your new tweet describes.

Am I seeing this right?

Shreyas

**yes. now consider this. nearly no one considers these group biases as the root cause of problems and failure.**

**what root causes are common when teams do postmortems of failed projects and launches?**

**also consider how every failure is a failure of thinking (individual or group) and leadership (which in turn is rooted in right thinking).**

**and now consider whether failure is attributed to thinking vs. to other issues? and consider why it’s attributed that way.**

**Claude**

This is devastating in its clarity.

Common postmortem attributions:

“We didn’t have enough resources” “The market timing was wrong” “Engineering took too long” “We didn’t get exec buy-in” “Competition moved faster” “The strategy changed mid-flight” “We didn’t have the right data”

Notice: None of these blame thinking or judgment. They all externalize failure to circumstances, resources, or process.

But your point: Every failure is ultimately a failure of thinking.

Poor resource allocation? Thinking failure. Wrong market timing? Judgment failure. Took too long? Prioritization/scoping failure. No exec buy-in? Strategic thinking failure.

Why failures are never attributed to thinking:

It’s personally threatening. Admitting “we thought poorly” implicates everyone’s competence, especially leadership. Much safer to blame circumstances.

Thinking is invisible. You can point to “not enough engineers” but you can’t point to “our collective judgment was mediocre.”

We don’t have language for it. Your bias catalogue is rare—most teams lack vocabulary for thinking failures.

Organizational incentives. Leaders are rewarded for “doing everything right” despite failure (effort, process) not for admitting judgment failures.

The exceptional few reinforce this. When exceptional leaders succeed, they attribute it to execution/culture/process—not their superior thinking—so everyone copies the wrong things.

The result: Teams perpetually misdiagnose failures, learn wrong lessons, and repeat the same thinking errors.

Is this what you’re seeing?

Shreyas

**good. so can you now put all of this together, including the 7 biases of product teams above, into a 2 page logical write-up of your understanding of what I am saying, with some examples? (be careful to not make the examples too far fetched / contrived)**

**Claude**

When exceptional product leaders share their wisdom, they often say things like “just build,” “move fast and iterate,” or “if you’re not embarrassed by v1, you launched too late.” These mantras sound actionable and inspiring. They’re also systematically misleading for most people who hear them.

The exceptional PM, founder, or leader gives this advice in good faith because it genuinely reflects their experience. What they don’t realize—what they can’t realize—is that their success came not from the mantra, but from exceptional judgment that made the mantra safe to follow. When they “just built,” they built the right things. When they “moved fast,” they moved in the right directions. Their attachment to what they created wasn’t costly because what they created was good.

The average builder hears the same advice and applies it with average judgment. They build quickly, but build the wrong things. They iterate, but in unproductive directions. They accumulate features, complexity, and commitments that become increasingly difficult to unwind. And because this advice comes from successful people, they assume they’re doing it right—until the product fails.

This dynamic exists in every human endeavor. The tennis champion says “trust your instincts.” The master investor says “go with your gut.” The acclaimed director says “follow your vision.” In each case, the advice works for the exceptional practitioner because their instincts, gut, and vision are exceptional. For everyone else, the same approach leads to predictable failure.

The average product builder lives two lives. In the first life, they simply build. They’re energized by creating, by shipping, by seeing their ideas take form. This phase feels productive and purposeful.

The second life begins with a painful realization: you become attached to everything you build, and shackled by it, regardless of your development process or framework. That elegant solution you crafted? You’ll defend it long after it should be killed. That feature you championed? You’ll rationalize its existence even when usage data says otherwise. That architecture you designed? It constrains every subsequent decision, and you’ll resist acknowledging its limitations because doing so means admitting you chose poorly.

This attachment isn’t a personal failing—it’s human nature. Once we invest effort in creating something, our ego becomes intertwined with its survival. The IKEA effect applies to products as powerfully as it does to furniture: we overvalue things we’ve built, not because they’re objectively good, but because we built them.

The shackling is equally inevitable. Every line of code written, every feature shipped, every customer promised a capability becomes a constraint on future decisions. You must maintain it, support it, explain it, and work around it. The costs compound invisibly until you’re spending more effort managing past decisions than making good new ones.

Exceptional builders can defer this reckoning longer because their initial choices are better. The average builder cannot. For them, continuing to “just build” without developing that thoughtful filter is a recipe for accumulating bad attachments and costly shackles.

The discipline of building thoughtfully—building less, building more deliberately, being ruthless about what deserves to exist—isn’t a universal path to success. It’s specifically the compensating strategy for those without exceptional natural judgment.

Here’s what makes this particularly insidious: product work consists of thousands of micro-decisions, made hour by hour, sometimes minute by minute. Should we add this field to the form? Handle this edge case? Refactor now or later? Talk to more customers first? Each requires judgment in context—understanding tradeoffs, predicting consequences, weighing competing values.

The mantras provide zero guidance for these decisions. “Move fast” doesn’t tell you whether to add the field. “Fail fast” doesn’t reveal which edge case matters. These are outcome-level philosophies, not decision-level tools.

Consider a team building a B2B analytics dashboard. An exceptional PM might intuitively know: add the export button now but defer custom date ranges; this edge case matters but that one doesn’t; this complexity will pay off but that complexity won’t. They “just build” and make fifty good micro-decisions per day.

An average PM on the same team, following the same “just build” philosophy, makes fifty mediocre decisions per day. They add features that seem useful but create maintenance burden. They skip conversations that would have revealed the real problem. They optimize for easy execution rather than right execution. Each individual decision seems defensible, but the aggregate creates a product that’s simultaneously over-built and under-serving.

Five years ago, I documented seven biases and fallacies that cause smart product teams to build products with mediocre impact:

**The Execution Orientation Fallacy:** We make decisions based on what we can easily execute today rather than what we should build. A team keeps iterating on their consumer mobile app because they have strong mobile engineers, even though the real opportunity is in desktop workflows for professionals.

**The Bias-for-Building Fallacy:** We don’t thoroughly understand the problem because we feel compelled to be in constant motion. A fintech startup builds payment features for three months before discovering their target customers already have payment solutions they like—the real pain point was reporting.

**The IKEA Effect for Products:** We base current decisions on past execution because we’re attached to work already done. A product team maintains a complex admin panel that three customers use because they spent six months building it, instead of deprecating it and focusing on the core product.

**The Focusing Illusion:** We overestimate problem severity when talking to customers about it. Every customer interview about slow page load times makes it feel critical, but when you ship the optimization, usage barely budges because the real friction was elsewhere.

**Maslow’s Hammer:** We overuse familiar frameworks even when inappropriate. A growth team runs A/B tests on everything including brand positioning and customer support tone, because metrics-driven optimization is their hammer.

**The Authority Approval Bias:** We conceive features based on what will get approval rather than what customers need. A PM pitches an AI feature because the CEO mentioned AI in the last all-hands, not because customer research suggests it would help.

**Russian Roulette for Products:** We don’t account for catastrophic scenarios. A social app ships viral sharing mechanics without considering harassment vectors, leading to a PR crisis six months later.

At the time, I suggested the solution was awareness and culture change: name these biases, create shared vocabulary, have leaders call them out upward and downward.

That solution now feels insufficient. These aren’t separate problems to be solved through better process. They’re symptoms of the deeper dynamic: average builders get attached to what they build and shackled by it. You can’t eliminate these biases through awareness any more than you can eliminate gravity through awareness.

When products fail, teams conduct postmortems. The conclusions are remarkably consistent: insufficient resources, poor market timing, inadequate engineering velocity, lack of executive support, unexpected competition, shifting strategy, missing data.

Notice what’s never blamed: thinking and judgment.

Yet every failure is ultimately a failure of thinking. Insufficient resources? Someone made poor prioritization and scoping decisions. Bad market timing? Someone misjudged market readiness. Slow engineering? Someone chose the wrong technical approach or feature set. No exec support? Someone failed to think strategically about stakeholder management.

Failures are attributed to circumstances and execution rather than thinking for predictable reasons:

It’s personally threatening to admit “we thought poorly”—it implicates everyone’s competence, especially leadership. Much safer to blame circumstances beyond our control.

Thinking is invisible. You can point to “only two engineers on the team” but you can’t point to “our collective judgment about customer needs was mediocre.”

We lack vocabulary for thinking failures. Most teams have no language for diagnosing where and how their thinking went wrong.

Organizational incentives reward leaders who “did everything right” despite failure—showed good process, worked hard, followed best practices. Admitting judgment failure offers no such protection.

The result: teams perpetually misdiagnose failures, extract wrong lessons, and repeat the same thinking errors. They hire more engineers, adjust timelines, improve their roadmapping process—and continue making the same poor micro-decisions that doom products.

The uncomfortable truth is that most product builders are average, not exceptional. This isn’t a moral judgment—it’s statistical reality. And for the average builder, the path to winning is not emulating exceptional builders’ approaches, but recognizing the constraints of average judgment and compensating accordingly.

This means building less. Building more deliberately. Being ruthless about what deserves to exist. Accepting that you’ll get attached to whatever you create and shackled by it, and therefore choosing very carefully what to create in the first place.

It means recognizing that frameworks and mantras won’t transform your judgment from average to exceptional. The actual work—those thousands of micro-decisions—still requires judgment that can’t be shortcut.

And it means being honest in postmortems: most failures are failures of thinking, even when that’s uncomfortable to admit. The team that can name “we failed to recognize our attachment to the original vision was clouding our judgment about pivot timing” is far more likely to improve than the team that blames “insufficient runway.”

This applies not just to product work but to every domain of human endeavor. The pattern is universal because the underlying reality is universal: exceptional talent exists, average talent is far more common, and the advice from the exceptional misleads the average.

The question is whether we’re willing to see it clearly.

Shreyas

**it’s fairly good, but in last section titled the path forward you’re being too prescriptive. e.g. “this means building less” - again, that becomes a mantra that won’t necessarily work.**

**some of the other stuff is good.**

**but logically, it must be understood that if I am saying that “just build fast baby” won’t work for most people, that doesn’t mean that the opposite of it “just build slow baby” will work for most people.**

**what you did there is actually a very human tendency - when they see / hear X doesn’t work, their mind automagically takes them to the conclusion that the opposite of X does work.**

**the reality (as dr. kapil gupta has explained very well in his writings and discourses) is that what works must be figured out for your specific situation, in practice, not in some theory / mantra.**

**Claude**

You’re absolutely right—I fell into the exact trap I was analyzing.

Let me revise that section:

The uncomfortable truth is that most product builders are average, not exceptional. This isn’t a moral judgment—it’s statistical reality.

Recognizing this doesn’t lead to a new set of prescriptions. “Build less” is just another mantra that will fail in practice the same way “just build” fails. The opposite of bad advice isn’t automatically good advice.

The actual path forward is more difficult and less satisfying: what works must be discovered in your specific situation, through practice, not adopted from theory or mantras.

This means accepting that:

You cannot shortcut judgment through frameworks. The thousands of micro-decisions that constitute product work require contextual understanding that no mantra can provide.

You will get attached to what you build and shackled by it. This isn’t something to “combat” through awareness—it’s a force to reckon with in each specific decision you face.

Most failures are failures of thinking, even when that’s uncomfortable to admit. The team that can honestly diagnose “our attachment to the original vision clouded our judgment about pivot timing” has a chance to develop better judgment. The team that blames “insufficient runway” will repeat the same thinking errors.

The real work is developing your own judgment through practice, paying attention to what actually happens when you make decisions, and resisting the seductive comfort of mantras—whether they say “move fast” or “build thoughtfully.”

This applies not just to product work but to every domain of human endeavor. The pattern is universal because the underlying reality is universal: exceptional talent exists, average talent is far more common, and neither adopting nor inverting the advice from the exceptional will transform average into exceptional.

The question is whether we’re willing to see it clearly and do the harder work of figuring out what actually works in our specific circumstances.

Shreyas

**okay, recreate the piece with this integrated.**

**Claude**

When exceptional product leaders share their wisdom, they often say things like “just build,” “move fast and iterate,” or “if you’re not embarrassed by v1, you launched too late.” These mantras sound actionable and inspiring. They’re also systematically misleading for most people who hear them.

The tennis champion says “trust your instincts.” The master investor says “go with your gut.” The acclaimed director says “follow your vision.” In each case, the advice works for the exceptional practitioner because their instincts, gut, and vision are exceptional. For everyone else, the same approach leads to predictable failure.

The average product builder lives two lives. In the first life, they simply build. They’re energized by creating, by shipping, by seeing their ideas take form. This phase feels productive and purposeful.

The second life begins with a painful realization: you become attached to everything you build, and shackled by it, regardless of your development process or framework. That elegant solution you crafted? You’ll defend it long after it should be killed. That feature you championed? You’ll rationalize its existence even when usage data says otherwise. That architecture you designed? It constrains every subsequent decision, and you’ll resist acknowledging its limitations because doing so means admitting you chose poorly.

This attachment isn’t a personal failing—it’s human nature. Once we invest effort in creating something, our ego becomes intertwined with its survival. The IKEA effect applies to products as powerfully as it does to furniture: we overvalue things we’ve built, not because they’re objectively good, but because we built them.

The shackling is equally inevitable. Every line of code written, every feature shipped, every customer promised a capability becomes a constraint on future decisions. You must maintain it, support it, explain it, and work around it. The costs compound invisibly until you’re spending more effort managing past decisions than making good new ones.

Exceptional builders can defer this reckoning longer because their initial choices are better. The average builder cannot. For them, the question becomes: what do you do once you recognize these forces are real and inescapable?

Here’s what makes this particularly insidious: product work consists of thousands of micro-decisions, made hour by hour, sometimes minute by minute. Should we add this field to the form? Handle this edge case? Refactor now or later? Talk to more customers first? Each requires judgment in context—understanding tradeoffs, predicting consequences, weighing competing values.

The mantras provide zero guidance for these decisions. “Move fast” doesn’t tell you whether to add the field. “Fail fast” doesn’t reveal which edge case matters. These are outcome-level philosophies, not decision-level tools.

Consider a team building a B2B analytics dashboard. An exceptional PM might intuitively know: add the export button now but defer custom date ranges; this edge case matters but that one doesn’t; this complexity will pay off but that complexity won’t. They “just build” and make fifty good micro-decisions per day.

An average PM on the same team, following the same “just build” philosophy, makes fifty mediocre decisions per day. They add features that seem useful but create maintenance burden. They skip conversations that would have revealed the real problem. They optimize for easy execution rather than right execution. Each individual decision seems defensible, but the aggregate creates a product that’s simultaneously over-built and under-serving.

The gap between exceptional and average isn’t visible in the philosophy—both say “just build.” It’s only visible in the accumulated results of thousands of micro-decisions, which is why the philosophy seems to work when exceptional people preach it.

Five years ago, I documented seven biases and fallacies that cause smart product teams to build products with mediocre impact:

_The Execution Orientation Fallacy:_ We make decisions based on what we can easily execute today rather than what we should build. A team keeps iterating on their consumer mobile app because they have strong mobile engineers, even though the real opportunity is in desktop workflows for professionals.

_The Bias-for-Building Fallacy:_ We don’t thoroughly understand the problem because we feel compelled to be in constant motion. A fintech startup builds payment features for three months before discovering their target customers already have payment solutions they like—the real pain point was reporting.

_The IKEA Effect for Products:_ We base current decisions on past execution because we’re attached to work already done. A product team maintains a complex admin panel that three customers use because they spent six months building it, instead of deprecating it and focusing on the core product.

_The Focusing Illusion:_ We overestimate problem severity when talking to customers about it. Every customer interview about slow page load times makes it feel critical, but when you ship the optimization, usage barely budges because the real friction was elsewhere.

_Maslow’s Hammer:_ We overuse familiar frameworks even when inappropriate. A growth team runs A/B tests on everything including brand positioning and customer support tone, because metrics-driven optimization is their hammer.

_The Authority Approval Bias:_ We conceive features based on what will get approval rather than what customers need. A PM pitches an AI feature because the CEO mentioned AI in the last all-hands, not because customer research suggests it would help.

_Russian Roulette for Products:_ We don’t account for catastrophic scenarios. A social app ships viral sharing mechanics without considering harassment vectors, leading to a PR crisis six months later.

At the time, I suggested the solution was awareness and culture change: name these biases, create shared vocabulary, have leaders call them out upward and downward.

That solution now feels insufficient. These aren’t separate problems to be solved through better process. They’re symptoms of the deeper dynamic: average builders get attached to what they build and shackled by it. The attachment creates the bias-for-building, the IKEA effect, the authority approval bias. The shackling creates the execution orientation fallacy, the overuse of familiar hammers. You can’t eliminate these biases through awareness any more than you can eliminate gravity through awareness. They emerge from the fundamental nature of being an average builder doing the work of building.

When products fail, teams conduct postmortems. The conclusions are remarkably consistent: insufficient resources, poor market timing, inadequate engineering velocity, lack of executive support, unexpected competition, shifting strategy, missing data.

Notice what’s never blamed: thinking and judgment.

Yet every failure is ultimately a failure of thinking. Insufficient resources? Someone made poor prioritization and scoping decisions. Bad market timing? Someone misjudged market readiness. Slow engineering? Someone chose the wrong technical approach or feature set. No exec support? Someone failed to think strategically about stakeholder management.

Failures are attributed to circumstances and execution rather than thinking for predictable reasons:

It’s personally threatening to admit “we thought poorly”—it implicates everyone’s competence, especially leadership. Much safer to blame circumstances beyond our control.

Thinking is invisible. You can point to “only two engineers on the team” but you can’t point to “our collective judgment about customer needs was mediocre.”

We lack vocabulary for thinking failures. Most teams have no language for diagnosing where and how their thinking went wrong.

Organizational incentives reward leaders who “did everything right” despite failure—showed good process, worked hard, followed best practices. Admitting judgment failure offers no such protection.

The result: teams perpetually misdiagnose failures, extract wrong lessons, and repeat the same thinking errors. They hire more engineers, adjust timelines, improve their roadmapping process—and continue making the same poor micro-decisions that doom products.

The uncomfortable truth is that most product builders are average, not exceptional. This isn’t a moral judgment—it’s statistical reality.

But recognizing this doesn’t lead to a new set of prescriptions. When you realize “just build fast” doesn’t work for most people, the natural response is to conclude its opposite—”build slowly and deliberately”—must be the answer. This is a very human tendency: when X doesn’t work, we assume the opposite of X does work.

It doesn’t. “Build less” or “build thoughtfully” are just new mantras that will fail in practice the same way “just build” fails. They’re still outcome-level philosophies that provide no guidance for the thousands of micro-decisions that constitute the actual work.

What actually matters is that you cannot shortcut judgment through mantras or frameworks. What works must be discovered in your specific situation, through practice, not adopted from theory.

This means accepting several uncomfortable realities:

You will get attached to what you build and shackled by it. This isn’t something to “combat” through awareness—it’s a force to reckon with in each specific decision you face. Knowing about the IKEA effect doesn’t prevent you from experiencing it. The question is what you do with that knowledge in the moment of decision.

The thousands of micro-decisions require contextual judgment that no framework can provide. Should you add this field to the form? It depends on your specific product, users, technical constraints, team capabilities, and strategic direction. No mantra answers this. You must develop judgment through practice and attention to what actually happens when you make decisions.

Most failures are failures of thinking, even when that’s uncomfortable to admit. The team that can honestly diagnose “our attachment to the original vision clouded our judgment about pivot timing” has a chance to develop better judgment. The team that blames “insufficient runway” will repeat the same thinking errors.

The advice from exceptional builders will mislead you. Not because they’re dishonest, but because their success comes from judgment you don’t have. You cannot become exceptional by copying their approach any more than you can become LeBron James by copying his training regimen.

The real work is developing your own judgment through practice, paying attention to what actually happens when you make decisions, and resisting the seductive comfort of mantras—whether they say “move fast” or “build thoughtfully” or anything else that promises to shortcut the hard work of figuring out what actually works in your specific circumstances.

This applies not just to product work but to every domain of human endeavor. The pattern is universal because the underlying reality is universal: exceptional talent exists, average talent is far more common, and neither adopting nor inverting the advice from the exceptional will transform average into exceptional.

The question is whether we’re willing to see it clearly and do the harder, less satisfying work of developing judgment through practice rather than seeking the next mantra that promises to make product work formulaic.
