# AI Growth Course 📈 - Brian Balfour

10 years ago [Andrew Chen](https://open.substack.com/users/108324-andrew-chen?utm_source=mentions) I created the first Reforge Growth Series. We defined key approaches to growth like Growth Loops, Growth Models, Activation Experiences, Habit Building, Network Effects, and a lot more.

While these things have stood the test of time, AI has introduced a feast of new ingredients. On October 15th, we are running the first cohort of the **[Reforge AI Growth](https://reforge.com/courses/ai-growth)** course. The course is four weeks, ≈500 pages, 20 hours of videos, and weekly sessions with featured guests to deconstruct growth in AI. I created it with [Bruno](https://open.substack.com/users/200077908-bruno?utm_source=mentions) Estrella (Head of Marketing at Clay), [Lauryn Isford](https://open.substack.com/users/9925981-lauryn-isford?utm_source=mentions) (Head of New Products at Notion), and it’s instructed by [Ely Lerner](https://open.substack.com/users/4355471-ely-lerner?utm_source=mentions) (Advisor and former Chime, Yelp). Details below.

We are in the most strategically intense environment in tech history. AI isn’t just another technology shift, it’s compressing years of competitive evolution into months. Companies that dominated their markets for decades are watching as AI-powered alternatives capture new markets in weeks. Meanwhile, unknown startups are scaling from zero to millions in revenue faster than ever before.

**This course is your strategic guide for navigating AI-driven growth transformation.**

Unlike a list of tactics that expire overnight, this course provides the strategic frameworks and mental models you need to create your own tactics as the rules of growth are being rewritten in real-time. You’ll learn how to adapt proven growth methodologies for an AI-transformed landscape where customer expectations spike overnight, traditional defensibility crumbles, and entirely new growth mechanics emerge.

_From Static Moats to Dynamic Advantages_

*   **Lesson 1.1:** Misconceptions of Defensibility in AI
    
    *   Understand why speed alone isn’t defensibility but rather a bridge to distribution opportunity, and how to sequence from speed to sustainable advantages.
        
    *   Recognize that distribution is a stepping stone rather than a destination, requiring active conversion into deeper lock-in mechanisms.
        
    *   Evaluate when data creates genuine marginal value versus redundant information, distinguishing between data accumulation and true data moats.

    *   Measure freshness and timeliness considering decay rates, real-time access, and ability to maintain currency better than competitors.
        
    *   Analyze depth and comprehensiveness in specific domains, specialized information coverage, and completeness relative to competition.
        
    *   Build reinforcement capabilities through high-quality feedback collection, continuous improvement mechanisms, and translation of user behaviors into AI enhancements.

    *   Analyze the progression from friend graphs (Facebook) to algorithmic distribution (TikTok) to AI generation ([Character.AI](http://character.ai/)) and its implications.
        
    *   Apply the AI Substitution Test to determine whether AI can perform your value-creating actions and whether it provides superior value through infinite availability and perfect personalization.
        
    *   Identify which direct network effects survive (real-world activity documentation, authentic relationships, team coordination) versus collapse (content creation, information synthesis, basic validation).
        
    *   Design strategies that either resist AI by doubling down on authentic human connection or embrace AI to build new types of defensibility.
        
*   **Lesson 3.2:** Cross-Side Network Effects with AI
    
    *   Master the three core marketplace functions (discovery, comparison, transaction facilitation) and how AI threatens each differently.
        
    *   Navigate the three attack vectors of discovery agents (funnel collapse), transactional agents (disintermediation), and supply agents (direct integration).
        
    *   Understand how AI compresses the traditional marketing funnel into single interactions, breaking LTV-based customer acquisition math.
        
    *   Evaluate defensibility across discovery (exclusive supply, real-time availability), comparison (proprietary signals, domain expertise), and transaction facilitation (trust infrastructure, regulatory compliance).
        
    *   Design marketplace strategies that focus on becoming trust infrastructure and operational complexity that AI cannot replicate through software alone.
        
*   **Lesson 3.3:** Brand with AI
