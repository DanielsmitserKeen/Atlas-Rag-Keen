# SME Tech Leaders Summit 2025

Europe’s economic backbone is powered by the unsung heroes—its SMEs—building in factories, service firms, and software stacks. And right now, those businesses are staring at the same inflection point: how to harness AI, data, and digital infrastructure not to _disrupt_ but to _scale smarter_.

That’s the pulse behind the **[SME Tech Leaders Summit](https://luma.com/ukbm0irn)** [](https://luma.com/ukbm0irn)— an invite-only half-day gathering where builders, investors, and operators shaping Europe’s next wave of SME tech come to think, argue, and connect. Together with **[CMS equIP](https://cms.law/en/int/insight/start-ups)** and **[āltitude](https://altitude-vc.com/)**, we’re bringing the ecosystem together to tackle one question: **what does AI mean for Europe’s 20–500-employee economy, and who’s ready to lead it?**

**[Registration is now open](https://luma.com/ukbm0irn) — and spots are limited, the first 150 are already taken**. If you’re building, backing, or scaling technology for the real economy, this is where you’ll want to be.
