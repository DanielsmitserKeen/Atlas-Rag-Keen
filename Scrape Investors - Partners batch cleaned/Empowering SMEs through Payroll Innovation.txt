# Empowering SMEs through Payroll Innovation

Payroll is one of the most fundamental – yet frustrating – responsibilities in any business. For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it’s not just about cutting checks; it’s about navigating complex tax codes, staying compliant with evolving regulations, and managing sensitive employee data with limited in-house resources. Darleen Warda, co-founder and managing director of Berlin-based Cleverlohn a portfolio company of āltitude, experienced these headaches firsthand in her early HR career – and decided to do something about it.

What began as a frustration evolved into a clear market opportunity. Today, Cleverlohn combines the scalability of software with the trust and expertise of human payroll professionals, serving Germany’s long-overlooked “Mittelstand” with a modern, tech-enabled solution. In an era where investors often chase fully automated models, Cleverlohn’s hybrid approach offers a refreshingly pragmatic perspective – one rooted in how SMEs actually operate.

In this interview, Darleen reflects on her founder journey, the realities of digitizing regulated back-office functions, and the broader transformation underway in the SME tech space. From AI’s potential to accelerate better decision-making, to the underrated importance of legal and operational clarity, her insights offer a valuable lens into what it takes to build trust, adoption, and impact in one of Europe’s largest – and most under-innovated – economic segments.

Before starting your own business, you experienced the headaches payroll management causes inside SMEs first-hand. Can you take us to the exact moment you decided “there has to be a better way” and Cleverlohn was born?

I originally started working in HR due to the high demand of support needed for people-related processes at the previous company I worked at. Back then, I became responsible for payroll quite quickly and we actually changed our service providers four times within 3 years. This included specialized payroll companies, tax offices and also self-service providers. Over time, my knowledge deepened as I wanted to understand what was happening and as I still had to make a lot of decisions myself. 

Seeing how many problems this caused and how much time and effort managing payroll still required – even though we outsourced parts of the process – gave me an ‘off’ feeling, making me think about possible solutions to the problem. It was actually my former supervisor who then suggested that we could either try to build something in-house or that I could take the chance to change something for the better not only for that particular company but for other businesses as well – this is how the idea for Cleverlohn ultimately came about.

Cleverlohn mixes self-service software with human expertise and works hand-in-hand with external tax advisors. Why did you bet on this hybrid setup, and what have you learned about making that partnership model seamless for customers?

It’s an interesting question because we were initially planning on offering a self-service solution only. What we figured out and what was probably one of our main pivots very early on was that other self-service solutions did either only succeed within a very niche market or did have problems acquiring a relevant stake in the market – even if they were very well funded. We saw how impossible it seemed to really penetrate the SME market with a self-service solution.

From how we understand the market today, the challenge of managing payroll is a lot about trust as the complexity of the topic comes with a lot of fears to make mistakes and therefore also hurdles to do it alone. Moreover, a lot of trust is built and exists with the tax advisory firms who are currently covering the service for a lot of SMEs. Looking at the opportunities in the market from this perspective, it makes sense to address the hurdles by bringing everyone together and reaching the highest level of digitization and automation for as many companies as possible. After all, our approach builds bridges: we digitize as much as possible while collaborating with tax advisors to ensure compliance, accuracy, and peace of mind for business owners. It’s working because we’re addressing the reality of how SMEs operate – not how we wish they did.

From bootstrapping to your first funding round, what were the toughest trade-offs you faced, and which lessons would you pass on to founders now raising in a tighter capital market?

I’d say that one of the biggest learning was the necessity to stay adaptable. As mentioned before, we did initially start with a different vision and needed to understand the signals of the market and adapt to that to get where we are today. For us it was always very helpful to stay authentic and true to ourselves. We are very happy with the business angels and institutional investors we are working with today and I believe that this match was made possible as we kept telling the story we genuinely believe is true. 

One big lesson still was how hard it can be to have a ‘human-in-the-loop’ or so called ‘hybrid’ service as a part of your business model. It struck me that many investors were obsessed with full automation and we needed to find the ones  who saw the potential and had the same understanding of the market as we did – which was mainly that Germany has the second most complicated payroll market in Europe, resulting in too many edge cases to fully automate from the get go.

You mentioned in an interview before that not every startup needs to chase unicorn status. How do you personally measure success for Cleverlohn, and how does that philosophy shape your team’s day-to-day decisions and company culture?

To me success is not only achieved by growth. To me, quality also plays a substantial role. We do operate in a market where the error margin you are allowed to have is comparably low but the customer lifetime value is even higher if you succeed in bringing a high quality service. Still people make mistakes and combining a software you build and a service you provide does bring its challenges. Even though the error margin is small, our perspective is that mistakes happen but they're not supposed to happen twice. So whenever a mistake happens it is our task as a team to understand why it happened and how we can avoid it in the future. 

Moreover, success to me lies in a great company culture as I truly believe that this is what enables and drives success in the long run. Therefore, from the early beginning, we offered a lot of freedom to our employees which is also something that attracts them to us and where we differentiate from an employer branding perspective compared to traditional tax consultancies. 

We all believe that this market, the product offering and the service can do better and this is what shapes our culture and decisions by always realigning on what can be done to achieve that – and broadly involving everyone in building our product, software and service.

Working with a variety of clients, what recurring gaps or misconceptions do you see when SMEs try to digitize core processes?

One recurring issue we observe is that SMEs often underestimate the complexity of certain administrative processes. There is a common misconception that outsourcing tasks like payroll or other HR-related tasks completely absolves them of responsibility. However, even with external support, SMEs remain accountable for providing accurate data and understanding the implications of their decisions.

This lack of clarity often stems from the absence of specialized departments within SMEs. Unlike larger corporations, SMEs typically don’t have dedicated teams for HR, finance, or compliance. As a result, responsibilities can become blurred, leading to confusion about who is accountable for what.

Digitization brings transparency, which is beneficial but can also be confronting. When processes become more transparent, SMEs are often faced with aspects of their operations they hadn’t previously considered, highlighting areas where they need to take ownership.

At Cleverlohn, we aim to bridge these gaps by providing not just digital tools but also the necessary guidance to help SMEs understand and navigate their responsibilities effectively.

As generative AI sweeps through back-office functions, where do you see the biggest upside – and the most under-appreciated pitfalls – for SMEs in HR, accounting, or ops?

From my point of view, the biggest upside for SMEs does not lie in the processes themselves but enabling them to understand their business better economically. Changing the transparency regarding their administration including all of the functions above can enable SMEs to make better decisions and become even more competitive with bigger corporations. 

I believe the opportunity overall lies in SMEs being able to combine knowledge and good decision-making with the advantage they have due to their size and company structure. This of course requires them to take the offer and actually take action accordingly. 

Referencing my last answer, the biggest pitfall lies in SMEs now understanding and owning the responsibility they have. Digitizing all of their processes and receiving all the knowledge, data and information requires an internal change at least to a certain degree as well – which especially needs to happen regarding their own understanding and decision-making. 

Beyond payroll, which pain points in the SME landscape still feel dramatically under-innovated, and where might the next wave of founders make a real dent?

Speaking from a payroll perspective, one of the biggest gaps we see is the lack of accessible legal understanding among SMEs – especially when it comes to labor law and social insurance. Many business owners don’t want to spend money on lawyers or legal templates, which is understandable. But as a result, they often miss out on both risk mitigation and opportunity creation simply because they don’t fully grasp the rules they’re operating under.

We frequently see this play out in areas like employment contracts, working time regulations, or compensation models. These aren’t just legal details – they shape employer branding, impact hiring success in a tight labor market, and influence how teams operate day-to-day. Founders who understand the legal levers available to them can design better roles, offer more flexible structures, and build stronger cultures.

So for the next wave of founders, I think there’s huge potential in building tools that make legal knowledge more actionable and relevant for SMEs. Not just compliance checklists, but products that help small businesses translate complex regulation into smart, people-first business practices. That’s where real impact can happen.

Fast-forward to 2030: what does a fully “tech-enabled” small- and medium-sized business look like day-to-day, and what role do you expect platforms like Cleverlohn to play in that evolution?

I imagine that the future will be shaped by seamless data flows and high-quality, real-time insights. In a fully tech-enabled SME, all the critical information – from payroll to performance metrics – will be instantly accessible, clearly structured, and easy to act on. Instead of spending time chasing information or clarifying responsibilities, teams will be able to focus on making good decisions fast.

Day-to-day operations will run on smart automation: a specific event or data point will trigger the next step in the right system, with the right people informed and ready to act. That kind of workflow dramatically reduces friction caused by miscommunication or uncertainty – something we still see a lot of today. Ultimately, it’s about turning administrative processes into a strategic advantage and giving SMEs the same level of control and clarity that large enterprises take for granted.

What is one book you would recommend for founders or aspiring entrepreneurs?

I really enjoyed reading “How to Stop Worrying and Start Living” by Dale Carnegie. The practical tools you get to learn about helped me to set things into perspective for day-to-day life as an entrepreneur. As a startup founder, things can become really challenging and you have to make decisions fast. The book helps you to forget about worries and fears and enables you to refocus on the important topics.

Thanks so much for the interview!
