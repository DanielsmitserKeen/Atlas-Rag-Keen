## Applying Andrew Chen’s Growth Loops to Early-Stage Companies

Growth loops beat funnels every time.

**Funnels:** Linear, one-way.

2.  Friend joins and repeats the action.
3.  Loop repeats, compounding growth.

**Example:**  
Snackpass—every order is a chance to send a gift to a friend, bringing in more users.

**Summary Bullets:**

*   Loops > funnels.
*   Output becomes input.
*   Compounding growth.
