**Mike Maples, Jr.** is a legendary early-stage startup investor and a co-founder and partner at Floodgate. He’s made early bets on transformative companies like Twitter, Lyft, Twitch, Okta, Rappi, and Applied Intuition and is one of the pioneers of seed-stage investing as a category. He’s been on the Forbes Midas List eight times and enjoys sharing the lessons he’s learned from his years studying iconic companies. In his new book, _Pattern Breakers: Why Some Start-Ups Change the Future_, co-authored with Peter Ziebelman, he discusses what he’s found separates startups and founders that break through and change the world from those that don’t. After spending years reviewing the notes and decks from the thousands of startups he’s known over the past two decades, he’s uncovered three ways that breakthrough founders think and act differently. In our conversation, Mike talks about:

*   The three elements of breakthrough startup ideas
    
*   Why you need to both think and act differently
    
*   How to avoid the “comparison trap” and “conformity trap”
    
*   The importance of movements, storytelling, and healthy disagreeableness in startup success
    
*   How to apply pattern-breaking principles within large companies
    
*   Mike’s one piece of advice for founders
    
*   Much more

**Some takeaways:**

1.  **Get out of the present:** Instead of just thinking about solving current problems, you need to immerse yourself in the future. Look for emerging trends, technologies, or shifts in behavior that suggest where the world is heading. Great innovations often stem from individuals who immerse themselves deeply in a niche or cutting-edge area. By getting their hands dirty and being passionately curious, they uncover insights, or “earned secrets,” that others overlook.
    
2.  Great startup ideas share three elements:
    
    1.  **Inflections:** External shifts that create potential for radical change in how people think, feel, and behave.
        
    2.  **Insights:** A unique understanding of how to harness these inflections and enable a future that the company believes in.
        
    3.  **Founder-future fit:** An alignment between the founders and the future they envision, in terms of their skills, motivations, and network.
        
3.  Three things that successful founders do differently:
    
    1.  **Movements:** Successful founders create movements, not just products. A movement aligns early believers around a higher purpose, leveraging their emotional commitment rather than just pragmatic benefits.
        
    2.  **Storytelling:** Frame your startup’s story as a hero’s journey. Position yourself not as the hero but as the guide (like Obi-Wan Kenobi) who invites customers (the heroes) to embark on a transformative journey toward a better future. Tailor your narrative to resonate with different stakeholders—investors, customers, employees—by emphasizing how they can achieve their aspirations through your vision.
        
    3.  **Disagreeableness:** Founders who challenge the status quo often appear disagreeable because they defy conventional norms. They drive change by questioning existing patterns and persuading others to embrace new ways of thinking and acting.
        
4.  **Develop non-consensus and right insights:** Form insights about how to leverage inflection points that are both non-consensus and right. The best startup ideas often face initial skepticism or hostility but inspire genuine love from a subset of users. Over time, early believers multiply until what was once considered heresy becomes conventional wisdom. Aim to create polarizing products—people should love or hate them at first. Neutral reactions rarely lead to breakout success.
    
5.  **Structure your pitch deck like so:**
    
    1.  **Slide 1: State what you do:** Clearly state what your company does in simple terms, assuming the audience knows nothing about your business. Example: “We’re Airbnb. We enable you to rent out your extra room as accommodation.”
        
    2.  **Slide 2: Highlight your unique insight:** Present a non-obvious insight that drives your business.
        
    3.  **Slide 3: Provide proof points:** Provide evidence that validates your insight and demonstrates traction.
