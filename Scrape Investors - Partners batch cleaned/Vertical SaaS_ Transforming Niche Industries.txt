# Vertical SaaS: Transforming Niche Industries

The SaaS industry is growing rapidly: Between 2019 and 2023, the global SaaS market is forecast to be worth a staggering [$60.36 billion](https://financesonline.com/saas-statistics/) and is expected to register a 9% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) within these four years.

When SaaS started, vendors focused on providing solutions that covered various industries (also known as **horizontal SaaS**). Some prominent examples include Microsoft 365, Quickbooks and Slack.

However, in the last few years, there has been a surge in **vertical SaaS** companies, which create solutions that are catered to niche industries. Some prominent examples include Veeva, Procore and Clio.

Now, the question is: What exactly is vertical SaaS? Is it the future? And if so, how do you implement it in your business? That’s what I will talk about today.

## **What Is Vertical SaaS?**

**Vertical SaaS** is a group of software solutions that serve the needs of a niche industry. In other words, vertical SaaS companies cater to the distinct needs of a single industry, such as retail, banking, healthcare or hospitality.

Vertical SaaS may be designed to solve a single problem or a myriad of business issues, but regardless of the model, all vertical SaaS companies target a narrow market. This model takes a more conservative approach to marketing the product than their horizontal counterparts.

## **The Growth of Vertical SaaS**

As with any product, constant use ensures its regular evolution.

[Software as a Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) really began back in the **1960s**, although it was known as “utility computing” or “time-sharing,” and consisted of the “centralized hosting of business applications.” Mainframe providers such as IBM offered services like database storage and computing power to enterprises.

Then in the **1990s**, the Internet helped evolve this service into “a new class of centralized computing, called application service providers.” An [ASP](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/application-service-provider-ASP) is a “company that offers individuals or enterprises access to applications and related services over the Internet, colloquially known as ‘apps-on-tap’.”

SaaS, as we know it **today**, is basically the evolution of the ASP model: It’s a business model in which customers pay to use software that is hosted by a company on a remote computer. [Netflix](https://www.singlegrain.com/saas/examples-of-saas-companies/) is a prime example. This business model has has been growing steadily in popularity simply because it provides greater flexibility for the customer.

And now we’ve entered a new stage of [SaaS evolution](https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v8_The-Evolution-of-Software-Revenue-Models-scaled.jpg?ssl=1) – vertical SaaS:

![evolution of software business models](https://www.singlegrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/evolution-of-software-business-models.jpg)

In recent years, several vertical SaaS companies have seen huge success:

*   **Veeva**, a cloud-based CRM and content management solutions provider to the life science industry, went from [zero to $2.4 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2019/03/01/vertical-software-10-things-to-know/#73986cf22435) in less than six years. They raised just $10 million in initial funding.
*   **Cox Automotive**, which offers a set of solutions for the automotive industry, acquired Dealertrack, an on-demand software provider for the automotive industry, for [$4 billion](https://www.ajc.com/business/cox-automotive-closes-billion-dealertrack-deal/zRs7LH0MDKjhPBW8vTRaUL/).
*   **Lufax**, a Shanghai-based financial asset exchange SaaS product that focuses on P2P lending solutions for banks and insurance companies, rose [in valuation to $39.4 billion](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2019-03-13/online-lender-lufax-valued-at-394-billion-after-new-fundraising-101391820.html) within a short span of eight years.

These numbers indicate that the vertical SaaS market is gaining popularity and will likely be a tough competitor to horizontal SaaS companies in the coming years. It means that no matter which industry you want to target with your vertical SaaS product, you will probably see a huge momentum in your product’s demand.

## **Difference Between Horizontal and Vertical SaaS**

Before you start building your SaaS product, it is essential to understand the differences between horizontal and vertical SaaS in order to determine what is right for your business so you can create your product accordingly.

This table explains the key differences between horizontal and vertical SaaS:

![Horizontal vs Vertical SaaS chart(2)](https://www.singlegrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Horizontal-vs-Vertical-SaaS-chart2.png)

### **Benefits of Horizontal and Vertical SaaS**

As you can see, horizontal and vertical SaaS enjoy different benefits. Let’s discuss the advantages for each of these SaaS industries.

### Horizontal SaaS Benefits:

*   covers a broad market, hence the revenue acquired is also enormous
*   companies have higher chances of acquiring a higher market share in the SaaS industry

### Vertical SaaS Benefits:

*   covers niche markets that offer higher chances of lead conversion
*   companies enjoy a lower [customer acquisition cost](https://www.singlegrain.com/saas/saas-cac/) and limited marketing spend
*   is compliant with industry-specific standards and requirements
*   companies often have higher customer retention due to the level of niche expertise they offer

### **Challenges in Horizontal and Vertical SaaS**

Though both horizontal and vertical SaaS offer specialized software to companies, they also face unique challenges.

### Horizontal SaaS Challenges:

*   has low customer retention rate as they don’t always meet industry-specific requirements
*   establishing leadership in a specific industry is cumbersome
*   has a high customer acquisition cost because the marketing spend is huge

### Vertical SaaS Challenges:

*   acquiring leads is challenging because the marketing strategy is centered around a small group of niche audiences
*   convincing prospects to migrate from horizontal SaaS (if they’re using it) to vertical SaaS is not easy

## **Vertical vs. Horizontal: Which Should You Choose for Your SaaS Business?**

The right type of model for your SaaS business depends mainly on your long-term goals. Ask yourself:

> Do you want to serve customers across multiple industries? Or do you wish to excel in one industry? If you choose the former, go for **horizontal SaaS**; if you choose the latter, go for **vertical SaaS**.

Remember, building a vertical SaaS product requires you to take a different approach than a horizontal SaaS.

To help you gain more clarity, here are some insights on how creating a vertical SaaS product is different from building a horizontal SaaS product:

*   **Horizontal SaaS** companies need to attract decision-makers from various industries. This requires that they create multiple platforms that allow their customers to configure (or customize) the product to suit their needs.
    *   **Vertical SaaS** has a specific target audience. This gives them the ability to offer industry-specific features so users can get started with minimal customization.
*   **Horizontal SaaS** companies often need to invest more in their products to demonstrate how their product solves the one-of-a-kind problems of different industries.
    *   In contrast, **vertical** SaaS companies are more capital efficient.
*   **Vertical SaaS** products need to consider industry-specific compliance issues to better manage data governance and improve efficiency.
    *   **Horizontal SaaS**, on the other hand, can offer one-size-fits-all features.
*   Companies in the **vertical SaaS** market rely on customer feedback to add and improve their product’s features.
    *   In contrast, **horizontal SaaS** focuses on features that address the needs of multiple industries.
*   **Vertical SaaS** companies must have various features that differentiate them from their **horizontal SaaS** counterparts.

## **How to Implement a Vertical Strategy for Your SaaS Business**

Now that you know what vertical SaaS is, its benefits, challenges and how it differs from horizontal SaaS, let’s take a look at how to implement a vertical strategy for your SaaS business.

### **1) Pick the Right Vertical**

As mentioned above, vertical SaaS solutions do not follow the “one-size-fits-all” approach. Instead, it addresses industry-specific challenges remarkably well.

Thus, it is imperative to pick the right vertical. By “right,” I mean an industry that has the potential for growth and is not nearing saturation.

Research by [Bowery Capital](https://bowerycap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Bowery-Capital-Opportunities-in-Vertical-Software-v3.0-FINAL.pdf) found that vertical SaaS companies in the manufacturing, [cannabis](https://www.singlegrain.com/marketing-strategy/how-to-market-cannabis-company/), transport and drones industry are likely to see continued opportunities:

![ijm](https://www.singlegrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ijm.png)

Here are other key findings in the research:

*   The restaurant industry is _not_ ideal for vertical SaaS because of its small market, limited growth and increased competition.
*   The education industry has a decent market size, but _growth is limited_ due to high competition and fewer opportunities.
*   The energy software market continues to grow with energy demand forecasted to rise by 48% by 2040.

Conducting market research is equally important. Once you decide on your vertical, identify the top ten SaaS companies (both horizontal and vertical) and check their offerings (both pricing and features).

Then, determine how you can differentiate your product from theirs. If there aren’t enough things that you can do to make your product unique, you will likely struggle to gain a significant market share. In that case, you should try another vertical.

**Pro Tip:** _Pick at least three verticals and conduct extensive market research. It helps determine the right industry that offers enough opportunities to outdo your competitors._

### **2) Stick to One Vertical**

It might be compelling to jump to another vertical because they also have similar problems or you wish to increase your customer base. But you should avoid doing that. Each additional vertical requires you to customize your product to a certain extent which will limit your capability to offer solutions to solve the problems of a specific vertical.

For example, **Innovaccer**, a healthcare data activation company that changes the way care is delivered, started with its focus on diverse sectors like finance, retail, entertainment and healthcare. However, in 2016, Innovaccer’s founders decided to narrow their focus to just healthcare.

They let go of their non-healthcare customers, losing almost 60% of their revenue. Soon enough, the company started gaining momentum and has [raised more than $120 million](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/innovaccer) to date.

**Pro Tip:** _Another benefit of sticking to one vertical is that you can acquire, aggregate and store industry-specific metrics. You can then monetize this data via value-added solutions like benchmarking or marketing reports._

### **3) Ensure that Your Product Offers Industry-Centric Compliance Tools**

Targeting a single market allows you to offer industry-specific compliance tools and standards. For example:

*   If you serve **healthcare** customers, you could provide built-in [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html) (Healthcare Information Portability and Accountability) compliance options. Here is an easier-to-read version of [HIPPAA compliance](https://www.accountablehq.com/post/the-basics-of-hipaa-compliance).
*   If you operate in the **finance** industry, you can offer [financial services compliance](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d71ecac6-a347-41b2-9609-d9aac5525b3e) options.

The more industry-specific compliance tools you offer, the better your product will be. This will also enable you to stand out from the crowd and penetrate the market much faster.

**Pro Tip:** _If you serve global customers, make sure you know the laws and standards of different countries._

### **4) Engage Industry Insiders to Understand the Challenges of Your Target Customers**

It is essential for vertical SaaS companies to speak the language of prospects and provide solutions that completely address the industry’s pain points. Doing so increases your chances of acquiring and retaining customers.

Insiders can provide deep insights into the industry nuance, which can help you improve your product. Another benefit of engaging with industry insiders is that it empowers you to quickly understand and adapt to the market changes.

Insiders could be anyone who has been in your industry for a long time, such as:

*   Your customers
*   Researchers
*   Professors

**Pro Tip:** _If possible, try to hire a few veterans in the industry because they have decades of knowledge and have seen the industry transform. They can offer guidance and help you understand the key challenges of the industry._

### **5) Promote Your Product Aggressively**

No matter how good your product is or how much better it solves your customers’ problems, if they don’t know about it, they can’t buy it.

Another reason to promote your product aggressively is that your competitors have probably been in the market for years. In order to make people choose your product over theirs, you need to build trust with tailored marketing.

Follow these tips to promote your product:

*   Conduct [keyword research](https://www.singlegrain.com/blog-posts/search-engine-optimization/little-known-ways-to-perform-seo-keyword-research/) to identify the terms your ideal customers use when they search for your product.
*   Make your site [mobile-friendly](https://www.singlegrain.com/mobile-2/mobile-first-indexing-2019/) and that it loads quickly.
*   Write a unique, [compelling title](https://www.singlegrain.com/blog-posts/blogging/how-to-write-hero-headlines-to-skyrocket-click-through-rates/) and meta description to entice searchers into visiting your website.
*   Create [valuable content](https://www.singlegrain.com/content-curation/absolutely-everything-need-know-10x-content/) to showcase your expertise in the industry. Address your target audience’s pain points and show how your product can solve it.
*   Visit industry-specific forums and answer your prospects’ questions to build [authority in your niche](https://www.singlegrain.com/content-curation/5-steps-to-becoming-an-expert-content-creator-according-to-googles-phantom-update/). It also helps drive targeted traffic to your site.
*   Run targeted [PPC ads](https://www.singlegrain.com/pay-per-click-2/how-to-use-ppc-advertising-to-get-the-most-out-of-the-holidays/) on Google and LinkedIn (as it is a B2B social network) to boost your reach.
*   Get your product on third-party review sites like [GetApp](https://www.getapp.com/), [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/) and [G2](http://www.g2.com/).

*   What is vertical SaaS and why does it matter for niche markets?
    
    Vertical SaaS is software built for a single industry with industry-specific features. It matters because it solves niche workflows out-of-the-box, reduces customization, and often lowers customer acquisition cost. In contrast, horizontal SaaS serves many industries and needs more configuration. Vertical platforms also bake in data governance and compliance (think HIPAA or financial regulations), which boosts customer retention.
    
*   Vertical vs horizontal SaaS: which model should my startup choose?
    
    Pick vertical SaaS if you want to dominate one industry with prebuilt, compliant workflows; choose horizontal SaaS to address many industries with flexible configuration. To help you gain more clarity, weigh TAM vs CAC/retention: vertical usually has smaller TAM but lower CAC and higher retention; horizontal has broader TAM but higher CAC. Want a second opinion? Book My Free SaaS Marketing Consultation.
    
*   What are the key benefits of vertical SaaS for early-stage companies?
    
    Core benefits include lower customer acquisition cost, higher customer retention, and faster onboarding via industry-specific features. Another benefit is that compliance is built-in, improving data governance and trust in regulated niches like healthcare and finance. Capital efficiency improves because you don’t need to support every industry. Focus yields clearer positioning and word-of-mouth inside tight communities.
    
*   What challenges should I expect with a vertical SaaS strategy, and how do I mitigate them?
    
    Expect tougher lead generation due to smaller audiences and friction when migrating users from horizontal SaaS. Mitigate by sticking to one vertical, engaging industry insiders, and shipping truly differentiated features that map to niche workflows. Pro Tip: Demonstrate compliance (HIPAA, financial regulations) and ROI with customer metrics; that credibility shortens sales cycles and offsets the narrow TAM.
    
*   How do I pick the right industry for a vertical SaaS product?
    
    Choose a vertical with clear growth potential and room to differentiate. Now, the question is: how do you find it? Research the top ten competitors (vertical and horizontal), compare pricing and features, and identify gaps you can own. Pro Tip: Shortlist three verticals, run interviews, then pick the one with unmet needs, favorable CAC dynamics, and less saturation.
    
*   Should my vertical SaaS strategy stick to one vertical or expand early?
    
    Stick to one vertical first. Depth beats breadth here. It lets you build industry-specific features, embed compliance, and gather proprietary benchmarks your customers value. In contrast, expanding too early forces customization, slows delivery, and dilutes positioning. Once you’ve nailed retention and efficient CAC in one niche, you can consider adjacent segments without causing product bloat.
    
*   What compliance and data governance considerations should vertical SaaS companies plan for?
    
    Bake compliance into the product for your niche. Healthcare demands HIPAA-ready controls; finance needs alignment with relevant financial regulations and audit trails. Strong data governance—access controls, encryption, and regional residency—speeds enterprise adoption. Pro Tip: If you serve global customers, map requirements across countries early so your architecture scales without rework. Compliance can become a competitive feature, not a checklist.
    
*   What are some standout vertical SaaS examples and companies I can study?
    
    Look at Veeva (life sciences CRM/content), Procore (construction management), and Clio (legal practice management). Each focuses on a single industry, ships specialized workflows, and leans into compliance. Notice how that focus improves onboarding, lowers customer acquisition cost inside trade communities, and lifts retention. Use these patterns to inspire your own roadmap, not to copy features one-to-one.
    
*   How did SaaS evolve toward vertical SaaS from utility computing and application service providers?
    
    SaaS evolved from 1960s utility computing/time-sharing to 1990s application service providers, then to today’s cloud-hosted subscriptions. Vertical SaaS is the next step: industry-focused apps with built-in compliance and niche workflows. The throughline is centralized hosting, but the value shifted from generic access to specialized solutions that reduce customization and speed adoption in regulated industries.
    
*   Which metrics matter most in vertical vs horizontal SaaS?
    
    In vertical SaaS, prioritize customer acquisition cost, activation speed, and retention—your niche focus and industry-specific features should lift these. In contrast, horizontal SaaS monitors broad market share and configurable adoption across segments, with CAC typically higher and retention more variable. Track LTV/CAC and expansion revenue, but segment by role or sub-vertical to see real signal.
