# SaaStr Annual 2022 (Event Summary)

## SaaS Secret Sauce: How the CEO/CRO Dynamic Drives Growth | Marketo’s Former EVP Sales Bill Binch (SaaStr Europa)

*   CEO & CRO alignment
    *   The CEO and the CRO should be on the same page about whether it is better to make the number with more smaller deals (SMB motion) or fewer large deals (ENT motion)
    *   After you close deals, the the time to score them on quality
    *   Iterate on your org. chart for the next 1, 2, and 3 quarters.
    *   Build a bottom up plan for how you will make your number – when you will hire and with what (realistic) ramp rate. Also factor in attrition.
    *   Every month, look at your starting pipeline & your pipeline conversion rate
*   What drove Marketo’s growth?
    *   Monthly quotas (even with ENT quotas) to help create a ‘pace’ for the business
    *   Default to more logos (even if at lower ASP)
    *   Optimize to get your buyer into a demo (esp. reduce the time from request to demo)
    *   Sales & marketing alignment – esp. to build your messaging
*   Three things that have changed
    *   Office based model –> talent is everywhere
    *   Enterprise SDR Model –> optimize buyer experience
    *   ABM –> ABM is not a technology, it is a process.
*   New, product-led techniques that drive high growth
    *   Less human involvement to provide access to products
    *   User telemetry
    *   Self-service models/virality (for expansion)
    *   Product Tours
    *   Calendars instead of forms (to get demo directly to AE)
    *   Weekly one-to-many ‘demo-nars’ (if you are above 30 demos per week)
    *   Simplified use terms

## What It Takes to Forge Your Own Category with Braze Co-Founder and CEO Bill Magnuson

*   Hypothesis (from 2011): New businesses will be mobile first and legacy business will need to invest heavily in mobile.

## Founder Confidential with @HubSpot Founders and SaaStr’s CEO | SaaStr Software Community

*   When everyone zigs, you zag.
*   To lower CAC, invest in product and customer success to drive acquisition via word-of-mouth.

## Growth vs. Efficiency: How to Weatherproof Your SaaS Startup for Tougher Times | Christoph Janz

*   Formula for disaster = growth went down while you kept spending based on original plan
*   Plan vs actual for total ARR may not show much; however, plan vs. actual for net-new ARR highlights the gap

![](https://i0.wp.com/sellingsherpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-19.png?resize=1024%2C330&ssl=1)

*   Most critical KPIs
    *   Net new ARR growth
    *   CAC Payback = CAC / (ARPA \* Gross Margin)
        *   ENT: <= 15-to-18 mos is OK/good
        *   SMB: Target <= 12 mos
    *   Burn multiple (Burn / net new ARR) <= 1.0. Top quartile from a16z:
        *   0-10M ARR: 1.1
        *   10-25M ARR: 1.4
        *   25-75M ARR: 0.5
        *   75M+: 0.5 (median)
*   With CAC payback, can look at:
    *   Blended (total S&M spend & new ARR)
    *   Paid only (exclude organic; can be tricky)

## CEO Systems: 5 Lessons Learned from Scaling at Every Growth Phase with HashiCorp CEO Dave McJannet

*   Building companies = pick the market –> find the people –> build the systems
*   Boil what you do into three pieces: required inputs –> abstraction of your system –> desired outcomes
*   A company is comprised of 4 plans/systems: financial –> people –> product –> GTM
*   Executives (re-) architect & build systems

![](https://i0.wp.com/sellingsherpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-21.png?resize=1024%2C457&ssl=1)

*   “It is systems thinkers, not experience, that wins.”

## AMA with SaaStr’s CEO

*   Have three plans
    *   C10: Stretch plan 10% chance
    *   C60: Base plan 60% chance
    *   C90: Safe plan 90% chance
*   Do whatever it takes to get (at least) 2 reps hitting quota. Then hire a head of sales.
*   Don’t hire someone unless you would buy from them. They must have sold software close to your ACV before. Early reps are smart and a bit more product focused.
*   “Great support is an ‘upgrade’ you can give without a line of code.”
*   Bootstrapping takes 3-4 years longer to get to $10M. Sometimes you have time, sometimes you don’t.
*   “Only raise money when you need it or it is cheap.”
*   It is worth it to hire great VPs in parallel.
*   A real first VP of Sales will bring talented people with them right away. They also have a recruiter they work with and trust. If they don’t hire anyone good within 30 days, then move them out.
*   Up to $20M in ARR, your customer success team needs to be product savants.

## Product vs. Engineering: How to Align Two Teams Infamous for Not Getting Along

*   3 in a box (at every level) = product lead + engineering lead + design lead

## Bootstrapping to $2B When Everyone Says It’s Impossible with Cloudinary’s CEO

*   Requires
    *   cost efficient initial product (revenue > cost)
    *   product market fit on Day 1 (or at least very, very early on)
    *   highly efficient GTM model
    *   fast ROI from Day 1
    *   Need to deliver >= $300K/employee

*   Many successful bootstrapped companies started as development consultancies
*   Find ways to be efficient (fewer people) by leveraging automation
*   Build a strong board of advisors
*   Hire a CFO early
*   Get paid in advance (by as many customers as possible)

## Scaling Revenue in 2022: What’s the Same and What’s Different? | Confluent President Erica Schultz

*   Rethink your customer and personas (to align product, marketing, and sales)
*   Design a modern & connected customer experience
*   Benefit from the multiplier effect of product-led AND enterprise (sales-led) growth  
    (start with either one and move into the other)
*   Create a consumption-based culture, not just a pricing strategy
*   Maximize growth while increasing efficiency  
    (solve for speed)

## 5 Critical & Company-Altering Learnings from B2B Startups | Y Combinator MD Anu Hariharan

1.  Is the product good enough?  
    (It is deadly to scale before you have product-market fit)
    *   If my product goes away tomorrow, how disappointed will you be?  
        (>=40% should say ‘very disappointed’)
    *   How often do you expect your customer to use your product?
    *   Is your inbound through the roof? Of, if outbound, do you have very high conversion from demo to customer?
2.  Many B2B startups are underpricing  
    (keep increasing price by 30% until you hit resistance)
3.  Companies can rarely serve all B2B customer well  
    (figure out your easy customers – they are your ICP)
4.  Early sales should not be delegated  
    (sales should be extremely repetitive by founders before hiring a sales leader)
5.  Plan to reach default alive (see Paul Graham’s [blog post](http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html) on this)  
    (Don’t grow so fast that you are likely to be in a position to NEED to raise money)

## Optimizing GTM for PLG with Stage 2 Capital Co-Founder and Managing Director Mark Roberge

*   The Growth team does the following:
    *   Free user acquisition  
        (high-quality, easy, rapid experimentation)
    *   Free user retention (\*\*\*)
    *   Monetization
    *   Expansion

*   Growth must be a cross-functional team
*   The Growth team should be in Product.  
    (If you put in Marketing, you limit experimentation to top-of-funnel since engineers don’t want to work in Marketing.)
*   The funnel needs to grow faster than your rate of sales capacity expansion
*   Pay salespeople more for expansion than for new logos (so they don’t add friction)
*   Reduce pricing friction: Put the paid pricing tier at after the point where power users get high value and before the point where executive leadership cares (ex: user role admin; tech stack integration; etc.)
*   It is really hard to move from being a non-PLG company to being a PLG company.

## Scaling a Product-Led Growth Model with 1Password, Apollo.io, Sentry, and Lightspeed

*   Let customers buy in the channel they prefer
*   PLG companies should experiment with outbound sales very early on so they are prepared when they need it
*   Inbound SDRs (and AEs) have a very difficult time transitioning to outbound
*   Every function should have a KPI that ties into the 3-4 key pillars of the overall company strategy
*   Strive to avoid price negotiations (transparent pricing & non-contentious terms)

## How to Sign Your First 10 F500 logos and Big Name Customers with Sequoia India

*   Warm introductions are critical (including from your VCs)
*   Be careful that you don’t simply end up a service shop for one (or worse several ) F500 companies; avoid requirements that only apply to one customer
*   Underpricing can actually turn off large companies since this signals that you don’t understand how complex and costly it will be to help them succeed. Price based on value.
*   Sell a solution, not just a product
*   Small lands work. Get a foot in the door first with a small pilot.
*   Don’t try to expand too quicky. Build strong champions first.

*   The best companies have sales as a % of headcount between 15% to 20% (but tune based on your GTM motion)
*   Don’t scale sales capacity until you have a good handle on your GTM motion

## How the Top Sales Leaders Really Get It Done | Flexport Fund, Rippling, and Brex

*   Hiring & ramping great sellers is the hardest part of the CROs job
*   Over-invest in the support structure for your top sellers (ex: over-produce leads for them)
*   Give an equity grant to first line sales managers for each rep they hire who hits their year 1 quota
*   Only hire more reps when your current team is “screaming” that they cannot take more meetings or onboard more customers
*   Rather than pay SDRs on SQOs, put them in pods with AEs and tie them to the revenue attainment of the pod
*   Be very deliberate at the top of the funnel by removing SDR & AE judgement about which accounts to go after
*   On hiring
    *   The candidate should be able to share with conviction why this job for this company at this time makes sense in their career arc (and you need to sell them what you will do over the next 4 years)
    *   Screen for curiosity – people who cannot ask enough questions on how the company works
*   Your first SDR hire should be a player/coach willing to get their hands dirty (with the intent of hiring and then moving into pure manager)
*   Split inbound SDRs from outbound BDRs
*   As you move upmarket, executive outbound outreach needs to come from a fellow peer executive
*   When selling large deals, invest in premium resources for SDRs and AEs (ex: high-end local events)
*   The most successful outbound campaign at Brex was champagne for CEOs

## $200M Acquisition: What Bootstrapped Companies Do Better Than VC Backed Ones

![](https://i0.wp.com/sellingsherpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-5.png?resize=1024%2C574&ssl=1)

*   Encourage customers to commit to longer term plans; you need to ask not only at sign-up but also especially 2 to 10 mos in. Consider offering a discount in exchange for the longer committment.
*   If/when someone requests to cancel, ask (a) why (b) what part did they actually like. The 2nd part triggers the nostalgia effect

*   Hire support & management capacity before capacity-based hires
*   In the early days, put reps on team quota (NB: Not all will agree)

![](https://i0.wp.com/sellingsherpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-24.png?resize=1024%2C494&ssl=1)

*   Give 1 month of quota relief for each year of tenure (NB: Lattice has been doing this for 3 years; presumably they will need to cap this at some point. There are two ways to think about this. One is one month of relief based on year 1 quota. This implies quota:OTE will fall from 5.0x to 2.9x by year 5. The other is to give one month relief based on immediate prior year. This implies quota:OTE will fall from 5.0x to 3.2x by year 5.)
