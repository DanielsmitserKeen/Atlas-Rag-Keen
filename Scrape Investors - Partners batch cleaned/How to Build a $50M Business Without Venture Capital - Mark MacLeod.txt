In this episode, we unpack his decision to step down, reflecting on a period of significant profitability and growth at Dribbble, achieved without the backing of venture capital, among other important decisions.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
In this episode, I sit down with Zack Onisko. Zack just quit his dream job as CEO of Dribbble. Over a seven-year run, Jack led the company through 35x revenue growth and 100x EBITDA growth without raising any capital.

We go into a bunch of topics in this episode, including his decision to leave his dream job, how they succeeded without raising venture capital, how to lead a company that’s entirely remote from day one, and many other topics. I hope you enjoy it.

Zack, welcome to The Startup CEO Show. It’s a true pleasure to have you here today. How are you doing?

**Zack Onisko:**  
Thanks so much for having me.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
So, I first asked you before we got on air how retirement’s going. And so that’s going to be my first question for you because I reached out when I saw that you stepped down from Dribbble, which was really big news.

And I thought that would be, first of all, as I thought about kind of where to take this conversation, I saw your journey as a study of contrasts and going against the standard way. Like, Dribbble was a bootstrapped company. You bought companies instead of looking to be acquired.

You stepped down midstream or, you know, not at the very end, which I know is something that people think about because the CEO job is tough, and so there’s so much to learn. But, to start, just tell folks what Dribbble does if they don’t know. I feel like it’s a household name in the design world, but maybe just tell folks what it does. And then leading to retirement, tell us about your decision to step down, and let’s just rip that apart.

**Zack Onisko:**  
So, just to kick off, Dribbble is kind of one of the last independently owned social networks. It is a community for designers that has grown organically over the years. We turned 15 this summer and we have evolved and become multiple different things over the years from the beginning to now.

But, at its essence, it’s a network. It’s a professional network for a lot of designers. They’re a place to showcase their work and get feedback from peers, but also to find new work opportunities.

So, probably 90% of our traffic is from non-designers who are looking at the work of designers for inspiration or to find designers to hire for the next project.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
Fascinating. As a brief aside, back when I was a VC, we led the initial funding round in Unsplash, which feels like it has some similarities just in terms of demographics. People showcasing their work, finding new work, etc, in one medium, which was photography, but some similarities.

**Zack Onisko:**  
Dribbble acquired Crew, which was the original Unsplash.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
Yes, that’s right. That was the original splash. Yeah, that’s exactly right. Unsplash was not what we invested in. We invested in Mikhail and Stephanie and initially, it was Crew, and out of that came Unsplash and, yeah, kind of doubled down on that. So, tell us about the decision to step down.

**Zack Onisko:**  
The decision was, you know, kind of a long time coming and, you know, I think in the early years of when you’re signing up for a startup, it’s really kind of, you know, to build enterprise value over time, and we’re very successful doing that. You know, I was a hired-gun CEO, so I came in right at the time that Andrew Wilkinson bought the company from the founders. We’re a majority share of the company and it was a time when Tiny wasn’t even Tiny yet.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
That’s right. And maybe you were the inspiration for Tiny.

**Zack Onisko:**  
Yeah, I mean, I think that was kind of the kickoff of, you know, now it’s become a successful holding company and with lots of companies, but…

**Mark MacLeod:**  
It’s not so tiny.

**Zack Onisko:**  
It’s not so tiny! I mean, there are 40 companies now, but at the time they had like three companies or more companies. So, yeah, it’s been cool to kind of see that journey grow, but, over the years, you know, the thesis to build the business has ebbed and flowed.

I was raised in Silicon Valley, and so that wisdom was my first instinct when I took over the company was to go raise money. And that was 2017. I borrowed a little bit of capital from Tiny just for working capital injections so I could build out the team, because I knew, like, I inherited the team as eight people. Like, okay, there are some key functions I need to fill in. You know, give me a shareholder loan. And anyway, that was paid back in three or six months because that plan kind of worked out.

But behind the scenes, I’m down on Sandhill Road and I’m talking to all the usual suspects in the DC world and got a lot of interest. So everyone knew Dribbble. But once I was exposed that Dribbble, at the time, was only doing $2 million in revenue and it was pretty subscale in terms of the amount of traffic and the actual website was top 2,000 in the world.

So we got a lot of interest and got pretty far on some conversations and got close to term sheets where into that year, from when we took over the company in January to probably call it like October, November, our margins had expanded considerably.

So during that time, I was doing the kind of dog and pony show which continued to get more and more profitable. And kind of at the end of that, I was like, well, shoot, what am I going to spend the money on? This is kind of an expensive check to cash. And so then I kind of backed away from that direction and then kind of from that…

**Mark MacLeod:**  
Which made them want you even more, I assume. Then they were chasing you down.

**Zack Onisko:**  
Well, it kind of just changed. I just didn’t pick up the phone after that. So it’s not even worth having the conversations. I knew at that point we had cash flow, we had a growing business, and it was profitable, so there was no need to take on additional capital and just have the pain of having a VC on your board or on a cap table who’s likely not aligned with where you are in the journey of building a business. So that was just the decision.

And I talked to a lot of other entrepreneurs and friends of mine, the CEO and our board, and we kind of just decided, let’s see how long we can continue to grow this thing. And look, we can always come back to the table and raise capital if we need it. But that day never came.

And the same thing, I would say the same thing with remote, right? So I think, you know, in 2017, being a remote company was very contrarian. And I shopped around the same time I was looking at office spaces in Oakland and San Francisco. Well, I’m hiring great talent remotely. We’ll just see how long we can do this.

We’re going to save so much money on those expenditures, and we’re not going to be locked into something like a 5, 7, 10-year lease. And so, double down on remote and then fast forward to 2020 everyone’s remote. But at the time it was a contrarian.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
I want to just double it quick in for a second, because, you know, the prevailing wisdom is you need to raise, and most startups burn and then never get even close to the success that Dribbble achieved. What was it about either how you went to market or just the nature of your opportunity that made it so capital-efficient?

**Zack Onisko:**  
Look, I mean, I think there’s, the landscape has been shifting for a long time, and there are certain businesses that do need a lot of upfront capital to get off the ground and grow. I think we see it today with no-code tools and the world has become more remote and global, so it’s just easier to staff up and build a company, or at least a software company today.

But I remember a time when I was first starting my career when we had to buy Sun micro machine servers, and those were $200,000 a piece, and they had to go into the real expenses you had to pay for, even outside the people costs. And I think those expenses have just been pulled away with AWS and with all these new technologies that have opened up just make it a lot more turnkey.

And so there’s a lot of startups in recent years called the last five years who are raising money for acquisition costs and employees attracting talent, and then acquisition.

And for us, we were finding great talent. We were lucky enough to have the way we were formed through Tiny is that we had a Canadian entity and a U.S. entity, which allowed us to staff in both countries. And, as we grew, we hired more and more Canadian talent because the cost of living was lower. There’s a 30% discount at the border, and so there were a lot of benefits to that and just the structure.

And then we also just kind of made a rule of less amount higher in San Francisco and New York, where there’s just a lot of competition and inflated salaries and there’s just great talent elsewhere. And so that was a strategic decision that pushed us away from San Francisco, where I’m based, but also needed to raise money and to attract that talent in this very competitive pool.

And then on the acquisition side, the nature of the business is heavily SEO-driven. My background is in marketing, growth, and exploring the different channels that we have at our disposal. And the cost was going to be really expensive. It had been inflating over the last few years. And I knew that just wasn’t a channel for this type of product that we wanted to invest in.

You look at affiliates, look at a lot of those channels that require capital to invest in, either through raw budget, but also having to build a team to manage it. We decided to stay away from that and focus on channels that we owned and were free. And so that was SEO. There’s an inherent correlation to the amount of UGC that’s added to a platform that expands the number of pages that could be indexed by Google. There’s a whole series of methodologies and just structured content that we leaned into in those early years.

And then email was always a big channel for us, another free channel for us where we leaned into user acquisition. So, of all this traffic coming to the site, can we get them to sign up, and get on our email list? And from there we can kind of segment those folks.

And then the other thing we’ve done is look at how we make money. We have this network at the foundation of the business. But we looked at, okay, we have all this traffic. So we have this subscription for designers that helps them enhance their profiles and get more exposure on the platform. We have this hiring subscription for people looking to hire designers. We have an education business for folks who are up-and-coming designers.

Then we have an advertising business just to monetize everyone else who’s here just window shopping. So we kind of layered those on over the years, optimized, and then we could segment basically through our organic acquisition and then segment into the product offerings.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
As you described those offerings, LinkedIn came to mind. Are you basically a LinkedIn for designers?

**Zack Onisko:**  
Yeah, I mean, that was a big inspiration. They had laid out this roadmap like, okay, let’s not reinvent the wheel. What have they done that’s been successful? We could probably do a lot of those things on a much smaller scale. But yeah, I think that was a big inspiration.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
Amazing. So tell us about the decision to step down.

**Zack Onisko:**  
So Dribbble acquired my former company, Creative Market, which YC company that I joined, like, 11, 12 years ago. So it was just a long run between the two businesses doing the same thing. And, you know, I have a, you know, I’m still an owner on Dribbble. I’m the second largest shareholder behind Tiny. And, you know, I grew the business thinking one day there would be an exit. And at some point over the last year or so, I realized it’s probably not the strategy that Tiny is going to seriously explore unless there’s a crazy outside offer.

And so, at that point, I think just for me personally, there are other things that I want to work on, other projects, other investments… And so, you know, I love Dribbble. It’s like a part of my, like, DNA at this point of, like, who I am. And, like, people know me as the Dribbble guy. Yeah. And so it’s a really hard decision. It’s very bittersweet to make that call to step away.

But, you know, the way I rationalize it, too, is like, hey, I was the guy to grow up to $50 million in revenue, but I’m probably not the guy to grow up to $100 million. And so let’s go find that guy, and I’ll pass the baton. And that would also free me up to go work on some other things.

So off the side of my desk, I am a real estate investor. I’ve done a few real estate projects. I’m working on a big one right now. But also I’m at the stage of my career where I want to transition from being an operator to being an owner/investor. And so I’ll likely look at businesses to buy at this point going forward and take that route.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
When I decided to shut down my investment bank to become a coach, it was a big decision, significantly aided by COVID, because, you know, in a six-week period, we had hundreds of millions of dollars of deals die, and so enabled a clean, you know, decision. But I approached that decision in two ways.

One was my gut just knew I would wake up in the morning and, like, I knew I wanted to become a coach. But I also then went and analyzed it. It was redundant, but, you know, I mind-mapped the decision and thought about it in every possible vector and came to the same conclusion and then allowed my gut to be right.

What was your process like? How did you arrive at this, which is, in fact, a bigger decision for you? You had more years. Like you said, you were the Dribbble guy and, you know, the bigger team. What was your process?

**Zack Onisko:**  
Not as sophisticated as a mind map. It was more of a kind of a, you know, I would say I made the decision probably a year plus ago in my head, and then it was like, okay, how do I do this gracefully so I don’t fuck things up. And so, you know, just doing the right… you know, bringing my board and having an honest conversation. They had me lead the executive recruitment process to find my successor, and I put my heart into finding the right person to take over, and I want this company to continue to grow over the next 15 years.

And so that was just kind of really important to me, is just making sure that I did a graceful exit, because it is unusual. It’s unusual to kind of leave when you’re not at an exit. But for me, is like, there may never be an exit. This may be a company that Tiny holds forever.

And so at that point, like, there’s only so many years, and there’s a lot of things I want to go work on, and so I had to find the time to go do that. And so this allowed me to, you know, this kind of break. As, you know, there’s a lot of, you know, risk to it. Like, cash flow is nice. There’s a quote. I forget who said it, but the three most addictive things in life are heroin, carbohydrates, and a steady paycheck.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
Oh, that’s a good quote.

**Zack Onisko:**  
Yeah. And that was it. That was one of those things. I was like, you know what? I have to cut the cord, and at the end of the day, if I’m not working for an exit at a multiple return, then I’m just a glorified employee and what I need to be is an entrepreneur.

And I’ve made a lot of guys rich over my career, not just at Dribbble, but in my past startups. And I’ve spent a lot of time just thinking about building wealth and how many years I have left in my career on this planet. The time that I want to spend working a nine-to-five job, even as a CEO, is as much as I loved building this business where I am in my life, and what I want next is really to spend more time with my family, to have freedom and flexibility over my schedule, to be able to do the things that I want to in life.

I decided like just pack up and hop on a plane and leave for two weeks. That’s the freedom that I’m after. And I’ve made some investments along the way. I’ve been outside of Dribbble. That’s given me a bit of a financial buffer. That’s going to give me some freedom to go explore some different things. Some may work, some may not work, but you know, I think at this point I’m unemployable…

**Mark MacLeod:**  
I think so, yeah. (LAUGHS)

**Zack Onisko:**  
And so it’s just kind of all about entrepreneurship at this point and not looking back.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
Amazing. You know, I’m on a bit of a personal crusade to help make the startup CEO role more sustainable. Most of the time when CEOs come to me for coaching, it’s because they’re burnt out, they can’t keep up with the growth of the company and they need help. And as a former banker, I can tell you the number one reason why CEOs sell is because they’re burnt out.

And I’m curious whether because of the bootstrap nature of this role and maybe the more evergreen nature of the opportunity, this role may be more sustainable than the standard burn-your-way to greatness kind of startup that you were probably exposed to, like were you able to create space and boundaries for your different roles as like a husband, father, etc.

**Zack Onisko:**  
So I think working for Tiny is great. So I had no pressure really from their side. So I don’t get too much transparency as a Tiny business, but I would guess that we were the most performant by a long shot, most performant business in their portfolio. And that was the pressure that I put on myself. So coming from that world, my previous titles were chief growth officer, and VP of growth. So growth was like my DNA and that’s what I was wired to do.

So even though I didn’t have a VC on my board, like, you know, yelling at me to grow faster, I put that pressure on myself. So we did push hard. We did have that sense of urgency always over like that seven-a-year period and that was kind of self-driven. And, yeah, I mean, I just don’t think we would have that success if I did operate it. Like, maybe some of the other companies in the portfolio, which were just more dialed in for just cash flow, and not focused on aggressive growth.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
So you set the pace. You were comfortable with the boundaries, I guess that is the punchline.

**Zack Onisko:**  
Yeah. But I think burnout’s real. I think I, you know, I think I was burnt out at the end. So I think those years of just trying a lot of things and some of them working, some of them not working, and it’s a very complicated story of what happened internally with all the, you know, the different seasons and quarters and years along that journey. And, you know, and I think COVID and the pandemic was also a piece of it.

I think that was a hit to everyone’s psychology. But, you know, coming out the other side of that was also, you know, you know, again, this mindset shift of, like, is this really what I want to spend the rest of my life, do you mean? Or do I need to stop and take a look around and see what else is out there?

**Mark MacLeod:**  
Yeah, right. You know the saying, “The change is as good as a break, but you never had a change”. Some folks exit and immediately go to the next thing, but you just kept going. And so, yeah, that’s hard.

So I’m based in Canada, and Andrew is a pretty visible figure up here. And, you know, you talked about an exit not being on the horizon anytime soon. And I know Andrew is very inspired by Warren Buffett, who just buys and holds forever. And I’m just curious, what other lessons did you learn from Andrew that might be contrary to the standard kind of startup way of doing things?

**Zack Onisko:**  
Andrew has been a massive inspiration, especially coming from Silicon Valley, where I think every move he’s made over the last seven, or eight years has been very contrarian. And now you see all these guys on Twitter starting holding companies, and it’s the new thing. But no, I mean, part of the reason for me leaving was heavily inspired by him. He wrote a Medium article in 2016 or something around kind of defining, like, anti-goals. Like, here are the things I don’t want to do in my life anymore. And, you know, and he stayed true to that vision.

And I think that the goal of Tiny was just to give him the freedom to build a life that he wants to build. And so, yeah, it’s been cool to work with him over the years. He shared books with me that have opened my mind to just thinking differently about things he shared and then just working with him on deals. Dribbble has done probably half a dozen M&A transactions over the years, and working with Andrew and his team on those deals has really taught me a lot about negotiation and value investing and just thinking differently about business.

Like, it doesn’t need to be that complex, right? Like, you work with bakers and we do these fancy modeling and forecasts and you do all this stuff and at the end of the day, it’s much simpler just looking at a business and like, okay, what’s the right price to pay for this thing? And, anyway, so I think from that side of the room, I’ve learned a lot. And then from a distance, just kind of watching him in his public persona and kind of what he’s doing there, I just think he’s having a lot of fun and he’s playing by his own rules and I think there’s just a lot to respect there.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
Yeah, no, there sure is. It’s funny, I popped onto the Tiny site before we started this, just, to see how they position themselves. I hadn’t looked at it in a while. They even talk about being anti-synergy. Like, what acquirer is anti-synergy? But they’re just like, no, no, we’ll buy you, you keep running it. Yeah, it’s pretty fascinating and very contrarian, that’s for sure.

You know, I’m curious, there’s probably lots of CEOs listening who have maybe thought about, hey, what if I become a buyer? What if I started expanding the suite of what we’re doing and moved to the buy side? I’m just curious, like, other than just practicing and screwing up and getting better, like, how did you build that muscle? You know, what did you learn from Tiny and what did you just kind of figure out yourself to become a serial acquirer?

**Zack Onisko:**  
I mean, I knew nothing about M&A coming into Dribbble and Tiny was buying businesses. I was like, oh, well, if they’re going to do that, I could do it too. Like, so I started to reach out to folks and, you know, a lot of stuff came in organically, and we started a bit of a search function internally, too, where I had a corp dev person for a while, but I just kind of learned over time.

But I think just being kind of naive, the beginning helps quite a bit of like, I’m not from the private equity world, I’m a startup operator. And so moving into that, you know, capital management, capital allocation mindset in real time, like helped, you know, with a lot of these conversations.

And I think also being the guy from Dribbble and talking to a lot of companies in our space and our outer circles, the doors are just immediately open and I could just easily get on the call with anyone and just have a conversation of like, does this make sense for you guys? And, yeah, I mean, a lot of the deals that we did close were like multi-year conversations, right? And they just, it was just relationship building and meeting founders of companies.

And when it made sense, we made a deal, but we probably looked at hundreds of companies and sent out a lot of offers that weren’t accepted to get to that handful of deals that we did close.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
Yeah, right, value investing, that’s another Warren Buffett pillar, relies obviously on buy low, sell high, and makes me wonder whether a lot of the companies that you ended up buying were either bootstrapped or lightly capitalized, because, of course, VCs by definition overpay. Otherwise, they end up acquiring massive stakes early on.

So they’re shooting for these outlier exits, which probably don’t fit value investing criteria. So did it turn out to be that way or did you end up buying VC-backed ones as well? And if so, were those distressed situations where they had to accept reality?

**Zack Onisko:**  
So I think the companies we did buy that were VC-backed were distressed, and then we bought some non-distressed assets that were bootstrapped. But with all the assets, we’re going in thinking, okay, we could probably grow these businesses. And I think there are synergies as much as Tiny has a very disciplined anti-synergy perspective. I didn’t as CEO of Dribbble, so we were looking at, okay, what are companies that we could, we could bolt on or we could integrate? We bought an iPhone app and an Android app that we reskinned and those became the official Dribbble apps because it was cheaper to buy those than to hire developers and build them from scratch.

Those are a very different strategy than a bolt-on or some of these others. We bought Creative Market, which was VC-backed and that was at the time they needed to raise more money to unlock a lot of growth. And I think they were going to be challenged to do either of those moves independently. And so, you know, that was a deal that we bought the business.

It was burning quite a bit of capital, but I knew the business, having worked there previously, and so I had a model in mind going into it of how I could turn the business around. And we took that business from burning $3 million the year before we acquired it to doing like $7 million in EBITDA last year. So, you know, that’s a huge success story in that one.

You know, the crew we bought and you know, we paid a great price for it, but, eventually, we decided to shut it down because it just wasn’t going to be something we could maintain. It required a lot of investment to turn that business around. And we decided the risk was too high to make that investment.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
Yeah, I mean, there are no official stats on this, but the prevailing wisdom is half of all acquisitions work out. It’s just that the half that does, they work so well that it’s worth taking the risk.

**Zack Onisko:**  
Structure is everything though. I think that when you buy an asset, the heads you win, and tails, you don’t lose so much are really important as you structure deals. Especially bootstrap companies. Like cryptocurrency ones.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
Yeah. I mean, so you brought up a really important concept that I don’t know if enough CEOs appreciate and think of until they become growth stage which is capital allocation, and that you are a capital allocator. Like how did you think through it, like I’ve got this core business that I could continue feeding. How did you think through investing into that versus investing into a tangent or something different?

**Zack Onisko:**  
I think it’s going back to when I raised VC money, I was having a conversation like “What would I even spend this money on?” At some scale of growth you can take the profits in the business and reinvest in the business. If there’s R&D, that makes sense, you see a market or there’s a new line of business we want to build or incubate, we just didn’t have that. We had done all those things and had a good well-tuned machine.

And a lot of the deals we did on the M&A side, I leveraged equity as much as possible to conserve capital. And so it was just kind of a conversation with the board over the years of, do we take the cash and reinvest it in the company, or do we sweep the cash? And that’s kind of Tiny’s model, is to take the cash from their businesses and bring it up to the head office and then buy more businesses. They’ve done a great job with that. And so I think that’s been a better model for them.

And then I think we averaged a deal or so a year at the Dribbble level, which was just from my mind, it was like, okay, we need growth, and let’s look at both organic and inorganic levers that we can pool. And it was kind of a mixture of the two all along.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
Yeah, yeah. That’s another Warren Buffet-ism. That’s why he owned insurance companies because they spit all of this cash that you can then use for other things until there’s, like, a catastrophe and there’s a bunch of claims. But until then, you got free cash, literally.

Maybe switching gears for a second. So, you know, you were remote from day one by design. A lot of companies were forced to go remote during COVID and a lot of CEOs equate culture with, like you said at the beginning, you know, foosball tables and being in the office. You know, what advice would you give CEOs, for really building companies remotely without sacrificing culture?

**Zack Onisko:**  
So culture is a weird kind of buzzword, right? And I think it means different things to different organizations. And, you know, when I took over Dribbble, we defined a vision and a mission statement and a set of core values for the business, and the heart of all that is that we wanted to build a business that provided a lot of value back to our community and to our customers.

We wanted, like, selfishly for me, and one of the reasons we went remote is I wanted to be close to my family, and I wanted to provide flexibility for myself, but also for my team and also my personality. I’ve worked at large Fortune 500 companies where it’s very political and people stab your back when you’re not looking and just not a fun place to work and I wanted to do the opposite at Dribbble.

And so culture for me was like, I just wanted to have a fun place where we’re spending most of our waking hours with these people, but we’re doing it over Slack and Zoom and so we did a lot of things to try to bring people together. We also did, you know, off-sites where we got together in person also, you know, once a year or so. But I think it’s been different at different stages of the business.

And, you know, I think from my managerial style and the culture of the company has shifted as well, from really hiring lots of really great executives to own different parts of the business, to have to pull back on the reins and owning that roadmap and strategy. I think the undercurrent is, and I’ve said this to the team, the most important thing for my legacy in my tenure running this business, I want everyone who’s worked at Dribbble to look back as, like, one of the best jobs they’ve had.

And that’s just from building the culture on a foundation of trust. Like, we’re not monitoring people, we’re not seeing who’s online, who’s offline. We trust people to do good work, and they do and look at it. And if they’re not, then it’s really easy to kind of see when they’re not, and then we have to make adjustments as needed.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
Maybe I know the answer to this because of the way you built the company, but do you think remote is just a better way to build?

**Zack Onisko:**  
I mean, it’s cheaper. So I think if you study the evolution of office spaces from cubicles to open spaces, there’s just a lot of inefficiency in having people have to commute from the suburbs into the city. And then you get in this open environment where people are shoulder tapping you, and there’s lots of distraction and noise, and it’s just not a very efficient place to work, especially for engineering and deep thinking work. And so allowing people to work from home or a coffee shop or from a WeWork or whatever gives people a lot more focused time, undistracted time, to get work done.

You can argue that Slack is distracting, but we’ve also done things like no-meeting Thursdays, and Fridays, we have no random meetings today. Or you could turn Slack off so big and stuff like that, really just to kind of maximize the efficiency of output, which I think a lot of people like. So I think from an IC perspective, if you did a survey, most people who are contributors will say they prefer remote work. And I think where you see a lot of pushback from remote work are the middle managers, where it’s more of a theater. Their job is to be seen.

And so, yeah, I mean, I think we’ll see more and more of the world go remote in this industry because the pandemic made hiring globally more of a norm, where even companies that were hybrid would still want people locally and, like, oh, you got to commute at least a day or two into the office. You’re still, like, nearby. But if you embrace remote work, you can hire people from anywhere, and you might have some constraints, like time zones that you’re sensitive to. But for us, we hire across North America. We explored South America a little bit.

There’s, like, a language barrier that was always prohibited, but it keeps your costs down because you don’t have that rent and overhead. And then also the salaries per headcount is lower than an ace metropolitan, super concentrated areas where, you know, you hire somebody, spend, you know, months in the recruitment process hiring somebody, they stay for six months, and they go across the street and ask for a 10% raise. So the environment’s hard to build a team, right?

**Mark MacLeod:**  
Yep, 100%. You brought up meetings. Did you find yourself moving towards being more asynchronous and kind of de-emphasizing meetings?

**Zack Onisko:**  
I think it’s ebbed and flowed. We’ve gone through periods where, like, okay, we have too many recurring meetings. Let’s just blow up the calendar. We’ve done rules where if there’s no agenda and the calendar invites, you’re okay to just, like, not show up. But, you know, at different stages of the business requires a different structure and a different kind of internal processes. When we acquired Creative Market, we brought that team into Dribbble, and we were one team. And with full-time employees and contractors, we were, like, over 100 employees at one point.

Last year, we spun out Creative Market as a separate company and hired a CEO to take over that business. And then Dribble became small again. We went from 100 employees, and all the structure that goes with managing that many employees back down to 20. And so we changed the way we work in those processes. And so a business is this kind of living, breathing entity, and so there are no hard roles that last forever. So we’ve always kind of stayed adaptive and flexible to, you know, changing the rules based on the needs of the business.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
I love it. Yeah, it’s super helpful. You know, all of my clients are remote today, but mostly forced. And so, yeah, it’s just great to get your insights, having just done it from start to finish.

As we start to wrap up here, I want to go back to why I reached out, which is when I read your post about meeting and you’ve walked us through it but I just want to get into your head a little bit. You began that post with the sentence, I quit my dream job today. So the day you left, you know, the day you weren’t stepping into, you know, checking in on your Dribbble email, what was going through your head? What did you feel like?

**Zack Onisko:**  
So it was, you know, I still have access to my Dribbble emails. I’m still kind of in the company a little bit. But, no, it’s a surreal experience. I mean, that Monday, April 1st, was the start date of Constantine’s first day on the job. And so I’m introducing the new CEO to the team, and I’m like, today is my last day. And that was just so weird… I mean, they knew. The team knew for a week, so it was very transparent with everyone. But they knew that day was real, right? It was the day it was happening. And so that hit me. So it’s bittersweet. And it was my dream job.

So I knew Andrew online, you know, even back when he was making, like, Tumblr themes as a teenage kid or however old he was. I don’t even know how old he is. But when I was at a company called Hired and was running growth and Hired was in the same building as Uber and Square.

But I was doing a rebrand for Hired, and I reached out to Metalab to submit an RFP. Andrew was still doing all the sales for Metalab at the time, he was still CEO there. So we kind of reconnected and didn’t end up going with all the different agencies. But then, like, fast forward, like six months or so, I get a text from Andrew, he’s like, “hey, I’m in the building. I read something by you.” And I go down to the lobby, we grab a coffee.

It’s him and Chris, his partner. And he’s like, hey, so I’m buying this company that’s perfect for your background. It’s like part design, part recruitment. I was like, oh, it’s Dribbble. I can’t tell you who it is. I’ll send you an NDA tonight. And anyway, his EA at the time sent over the NDA, but in an email, the subject line said NDA for Dribbble acquisition, very discreet.

Do I still need to sign this thing? But I called the next day. I’m like, I’m 100% in, and he hadn’t even closed the deal yet. This is like October, and the deal didn’t close until early January or something. But that next day or that week or whatever, I resigned from Hired. I’m like, you know what? I haven’t received an offer from Andrew. He doesn’t even own the company yet. But that is just what I’m going to go do, and that’s my next journey.

So, it was my dream job. At a previous company, just watching the birth of Dribbble was just this kind of amazing thing. People were selling Dribbble invites on secondary markets and I interviewed a designer for a company that I was at and asked the designer for an invite to Dribbble because they were just so hard to get at the time. So just, you know, I’ve been watching the company grow from the sidelines for years, and so just to have the opportunity to join the company in any role, let alone the CEO role, was a dream and it was a hell of a run. We had a great time and yeah, it was a journey.

**Mark MacLeod:**  
I’m really glad you shared that history. That just makes it more special. Well, Zack, thank you so much for making the time. I’m excited for you and I’m so glad I reached out because this is just a special moment and I’m really glad that you were able to share that moment with everyone here. Thank you so much.
