# Designing the Ideal Bootstrapped Business · mtlynch.io

Jason Cohen’s 2013 Microconf talk, [_Designing the Ideal Bootstrapped Business with Jason Cohen_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw), is one of the most valuable resources I’ve found for bootstrapped founders. I watched it for the first time [in 2020](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-3/#you-can-build-a-successful-business-without-being-available-247), and I’ve revisited it repeatedly since then.

If you’re new to the world of bootstrapped software business, or you’re struggling to gain traction with your business, I highly recommend this talk.

Below, I’ve included my notes.

## [Most businesses don’t work](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#most-businesses-don)

*   Most businesses fail.
    *   Most fail because they build a product that customers don’t actually want.
    *   Some fail because they’re building a product customers want but with a business structure that’s incompatible with bootstrapping.

## [Jason’s background](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=46) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#jason)

*   Jason is founder of [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com/), one of the most popular WordPress hosting vendors.
*   Jason founded four companies.
    *   All made over $1M/yr.
    *   All of them were profitable.
    *   Jason sold two of them.
    *   All were bootstrapped, although WPEngine later raised venture capital.

## [A “cash machine”](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=120) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#a)

*   The ideal self-funded business is a “cash machine.”
    *   The business has a predictable way to make profit every month.
*   20% of people in the conference audience would make $10k the following month if they invested zero work into their business.
*   Goal of self-funded business: earn at least $10k/month in revenue per founder.
    *   _\[**Ed**: He says “revenue” but I suspect he means “profit”\]_

## [Revenue model](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=202) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#revenue-model)

### [One-offs never get easier](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=202) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#one-offs-never-get-easier)

*   One-off sales never get easier.
    *   Every month, you start over with $0 in revenue.
*   One-off sales are the opposite of a cash machine.
*   Even when Jason Cohen’s previous company (Smart Bear, one-off sales) reached millions in revenue per month, he still worried he’d fail to meet payroll every month.
    *   The stress never went away.

### [Recurring revenue: the only way](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=4m21s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#recurring-revenue-the-only-way)

*   The myth of “1,000 true fans”
    *   Kevin Kelly [introduced the idea](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) of 1,000 true fans
    *   Musicians could gain indepedence from music labels if they could convince 1,000 passionate fans to buy $100-200 in merch and concerts or other purchases that go directly to the artist.
    *   Seth Godin [popularized the idea](https://seths.blog/2008/03/1000-true-fans/) by sharing the blog post with a larger audience.
    *   Kevin Kelly got feedback from musicians that his idea wasn’t practical and walked back the idea.
        *   It’s difficult to get that many fans to give you recurring revenue.
        *   For musicians, $100-200k/yr is not enough to cover the costs of touring.
    *   Godin never acknowledged the retraction, so the myth persists.
*   Better target: 150 customers
    *   You should have 20-30 customers waiting to pay you monthly before you even start building.
        *   If you can’t find 20-30 in the first few months, it’s going to be hard to reach a sustainable customer base ever.
    *   First 50: Scratching and clawing your first customers
    *   Next 25: Guest postings, social media
    *   Next 75: Basic marketing

### [WPEngine’s first customers](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=7m10s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#wpengine)

*   Jason found 40 WordPress consultants on LinkedIn.
*   He said he had a new product designed to serve them.
*   **Key**: He offered to pay them to talk to him.
    *   The pay was “whatever \[they\] thought was fair,” even if it’s higher than their normal hourly rate because it’s a one-off job.
*   100% agreed to speak with him on the phone.
    *   38 actually scheduled calls.
    *   0 asked for any money.
*   **Takeaway**: Showing that you value their time yields positive results.

### [Pricing](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=9m30s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#pricing)

*   If the revenue goal is $10k/mo and the customer base is 150 customers, you need to charge each customer $66/mo, on average.
    *   $10k / 150 customers = $66/customer/mo.
*   Most founders charge a lower rate because their service is crappy starting out.
    *   Everything is barebones, support is slow because it’s just the founder.
    *   Founder decides to charge $19/mo because they assume their product isn’t worth a higher rate.
    *   Lower price means you have to find more customers, difficult to do.
*   Strategies
    *   Price tiers
        *   WPEngine had three tiers segmented by customer type: $49 / $99 / $249
        *   Average revenue per customer was over $100/mo.
    *   High prices, but lots of coupon opportunities
        *   Example: Standard rate is $99/mo, but give bloggers a 30% off coupon for their readers.
            *   Ends up being the $66/mo target.

### [Boutique business](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=12m06s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#boutique-business)

*   What do you think when you hear the word “boutique?”
    *   Small
    *   Not open very much because it has a small staff, usually just owners
    *   Expensive
    *   Customers receive lots of personal attention
    *   Work is special and unique
    *   Customers feel good supporting the business
*   Present yourself to customers as “boutique.”
    *   Customers will tolerate higher prices if they think of it as supporting an independent boutique vendor.

### [Cash flow](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=13m20s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#cash-flow)

*   Cash is king.
*   The “annual pre-pay trick”
    *   “You have to do it.” -Jason Cohen
    *   Example marketing scenario
        *   Spending $300 on Google Ads gets you $50/mo in recurring revenue.
        *   Therefore, spending $60k gets you $10k/mo in recurring revenue.
            *   _\[**Ed**: I disagree with this point, as Google Ads don’t scale linearly like this. Scaling your spending from $300 to $60k means you have to bid higher for each click to capture a greater share of the results. I think a more realistic scenario is that if you scale your Google Ad spend by 20x, you’d see 10-15x the conversions.\]_
        *   You could reach your target monthly revenue right now if you had $60k in cash to spend.
        *   Tell customers they get two months free with an annual plan.
        *   You’d get $100k in cash immediately as opposed to $120k over the course of a year.
        *   After the $60k on Google Ads, you’d have $40k left over to spend immediately on marketing, design improvements, etc. rather than waiting to collect the recurring revenue over a year.
*   WPEngine’s numbers
    *   1/4 of signups pre-pay for a year.
        *   75% pay 1x month
        *   25% pay 10x month
        *   0.75 x 1 + 0.25 x 10 = 3.25
        *   Translation: WPEngine gets 3.25x the cash flow as they would without annual pre-pay option.
        *   WPEngine’s cost of customer acquisition is lower than their monthly cash flow, so they effectively have an infinite marketing budget
*   You can combine annual pre-pay with coupons to make them more enticing.
    *   Example: Coupon gives you three months free on annual plan.
        *   They would have gotten two without the coupon, but three sounds more exciting.
*   You can adjust pricing to make pre-payment more appealing.
    *   Increase monthly price, and make annual discount steeper.

### [Free trials](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=21m07s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#free-trials)

*   Most people who sign up with a credit card will stay.
*   If they do the trial and never convert, you lose money.
*   Instead, offer a 60-day money back guarantee.
    *   Charge customers up front, but let them cancel easily.
    *   When WPEngine made this change, signups increased.
        *   Customers liked the change. They said it gave them more time to evaluate the product.

### [No picking up pennies](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=23m16s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#no-picking-up-pennies)

*   Example: Kickstarter
    *   Lots of money flowing through.
    *   Kickstarter “picks up pennies” by taking a small percentage.
    *   Kickstarter raised $100M in funds, only $6M of the revenue went to Kickstarter.
    *   They finished the year at a loss and had to raise more money.
    *   Kickstarter is one of the most successful examples of this, and they have trouble turning a profit.
*   Cohen recommends against this model for bootstrapped businesses.
    *   “Go get customers, and charge them lots of money.”

## [Market model](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=24m05s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#market-model)

*   What markets are conducive to a cash machine company?

### [Only build B2B companies](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=24m29s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#only-build-b2b-companies)

*   Never sell to consumers.
    *   Cohen quoted an app store review that complained that a $1.99 app should have been priced at $0.99.
        *   Consumers are too price-sensitive and demanding.
*   Every Microconf speaker that year had a B2B business.
    *   Exception: patio11 with BingoCardCreator, but he recommends against B2C as well.

### [Bad Market: Point-in-time / temporary pain](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=26m44s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#bad-market-point-in-time--temporary-pain)

*   Examples
    *   Weddings
    *   Events
    *   Code profilers
*   You have to catch customers at the exact right time.
*   For things like weddings, you’re competing with tons of companies trying to market to brides/grooms in the months leading up to a wedding.

### [Good Market: Naturally recurring market](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=28m25s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#good-market-naturally-recurring-market)

*   Ongoing actual costs
    *   Example: Server hosting
        *   People know that servers are an ongoing cost, so they expect to pay for hosting on a recurring basis.
*   Financial cycles
    *   Example: taxes, invoicing, compliance
        *   People have to do these things regularly.
*   Pain naturally changes over time
    *   Example: digital marketing, SEO
        *   The underlying market changes, so the tools have to adapt.
*   Offering support
    *   Example: $100/mo for a premium support queue.
        *   “Free money” because you want to resolve all tickets anyway, but this just changes the order that you process tickets.

### [Bad Market: Viralityness](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=31m54s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#bad-market-viralityness)

*   Viral products almost never work.
*   If your viral coefficient is 1% per month (pretty good), and you have 100 users, that means you only get 0 or 1 new users per month.
*   Viral products only work when you have a large customer base.
    *   It’s expensive to build to that critical mass.

### [Good Market: Not real-time](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=32m43s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#good-market-not-real-time)

*   A non-real time business is one where it’s not a disaster if your product is down for a few hours.
*   WPEngine (hosting) is a bad example, as any outage is a disaster.
    *   “That was a mistake.”
    *   WPEngine’s support staff has to wake up in the middle of the night to fix severe issues.
*   Examples
    *   Analytics, decision support
    *   Finance - Finance employees typically have a buffer around their timelines
    *   Project management - If Trello is down for an hour, you’re probably not going to cancel your subscription
    *   Content - Can be down for a few hours, but it’s also easy to make always available on a static site

### [Bad Market: Marketplaces](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=34m30s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#bad-market-marketplaces)

*   Platform that matches buyers with sellers
*   Examples
    *   Etsy, Kickstarter, eBay
*   Difficult to get off the ground
    *   You have to attract sellers and offer the functionality they need.
    *   You have to attract buyers simultaneously.
    *   It’s costly to attract and support both.
*   You’re effectively starting two high-risk companies.
    *   Both have to succeed in order for the marketplace to be sustainable.

### [Good Market: Something that can be “finished”](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=36m07s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#good-market-something-that-can-be)

*   Examples
    *   WinZIP, Freshbooks, Basecamp, hosting, time-tracking, bug-tracking, CRM, wiki, task management, email, PDF editor, image editor, web analytics
*   You don’t want to get stuck in a feature war with a competitor.
    *   As a bootstrapper, you’ll have fewer resources to build features, so you’re at a disadvantage.

### [Good Market: Aftermarkets](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=37m12s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#good-market-aftermarkets)

*   Find an established product with a significant following, and build add-ons or integrations.
*   Examples
    *   Smart Bear: Added code review to Perforce and Subversion
    *   Balsamiq: Started as add-ons to Basecamp
    *   WooThemes: Themes for WooCommerce
    *   AlienSkin: Paid plugins for Photoshop
    *   QODBC: Makes ODBC interface for QuickBooks, allows customers to make database queries against it
*   Ecosystems
    *   Some ecosystems are friendlier than others to aftermarkets
        *   Apple App Store
            *   Apple is semi-hostile to third-party apps.
            *   Apple sometimes introduces [first-party apps](https://www.howtogeek.com/297651/what-does-it-mean-when-a-company-sherlocks-an-app/) to compete with third-party vendors on their platform.
        *   Salesforce, Heroku
            *   They’re committed not to compete with aftermarket vendors.
            *   They limit the features they implement themselves in order to foster an ecosystem of third-party tools.
*   Vendors are often interested in supporting aftermarket vendors.
    *   Aftermarket vendors make the first party vendor’s product more valuable.

### [Good Market: Big market](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=40m10s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#good-market-big-market)

*   In a large market, you have many niches to inhabit.
    *   There’s always a risk that your niche is too small, but in a large market, it’s easier to find adjacent niches.
*   Big market gives instant validation that the pain point exists and people are paying to solve it.
*   Big market gives you the option to grow from a lifestyle business to a billion dollar business if you want.

## [Acquisition model](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=42m40s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#acquisition-model)

*   Jason doesn’t like social media as a way of acquiring customers.
*   People underestimate the cost of social media marketing and overestimate its effectiveness.
*   Social media typically doesn’t yield customers who want to pay a recurring price.
*   Jason Cohen’s blog had 40,000 subscribers.
    *   Only two signed up when he launched WPEngine.
    *   Hiten Shah observed a similar effect.
        *   Having a large following didn’t translate to customers.

### [How much to pay per click?](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=44m47s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#how-much-to-pay-per-click)

*   Rule of thumb: Cost per click = Average monthly revenue per customer / 25
    *   Example: $50/month in revenue, pay $2 per click ($50 / 25 = $2)
    *   The exact cost varies depending on your business.
    *   The full derivation is [on Jason’s blog](https://blog.asmartbear.com/bootstrapped-cpc.html).

## [The squeeze](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=45m40s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#the-squeeze)

*   What happens if you successfully build a cash machine?
    *   Your business will keep growing.
    *   To sustain more customers, you need to hire more people.
    *   Your job shifts from marketing and development to coding.
    *   Do you still want to run a company like that?
*   Paths forward
    *   Sell before it’s too big
        *   You can arrange a sale with an earnout if the new owner doesn’t have cash up front.
            *   e.g., $20-30k/month for three years
    *   Sell to partners
    *   Sell to your biggest customer
    *   Raise prices
    *   Raise venture funding to grow even more
        *   If you’re willing to do venture capital, you should start with it rather than a slower start with bootstrapping

### [How to decide what to do next](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=50m49s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#how-to-decide-what-to-do-next)

*   [Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus) was Greek businessman-turned-philosopher.
    *   When asked what is the hardest thing, he said “to know thyself.”
*   Understand what brings you fulfillment.
    *   Understand that it changes over time.
*   Talk to people who have been through this path before.

## [Summary](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=52m17s) [🔗︎](https://mtlynch.io/notes/designing-the-ideal-bootstrapped-business/#summary)

Formula for success in a self-funded business:

*   Predictable acquisition
*   Recurring revenue
*   Annual pre-pay
*   Good market
