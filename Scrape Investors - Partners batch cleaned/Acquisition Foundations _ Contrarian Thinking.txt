## Course Intro

## Most people believe that betting on yourself looks like this:

### You need to bet the house to buy a business.

### Only the really rich can afford a business.

### Being an employee is safer than owning.

### Start-ups are sexier than boring businesses.

## The American Dream is still possible — but nobody’s shown you the path. We’ll guide  you through the exact steps you need to take to go from Buyer to Owner.

## Contrarians _think different._

"The course is incredibly valuable even more so than my masters in engineering management. Would highly recommend!"

"I believe I’m just scratching the surface but the Acquisitions Foundations course was worth the time and effort. Would highly recommend to others if they are serious about buying a business!"

"The resources are well-organized, easy to access, and referenced in multiple places, making them simple to revisit when needed. I've found that the more I engage with the community—whether through helping others, attending calls, or going to events—the more value I get in return."

"The course is amazing but the real value comes from the masterminds inside the community. It makes a scary thing seem achievable and the resources inside the groups are second to none."

"The coursework was super easy and very informative. I have reviewed so many deals in this time, expanded my network and found my deal team, and have locked in on a deal and hope to close in 3 months."

"The course had a clear plan and steps to follow from starting our search all the way through after closing. We followed the plan and were able to get a business under contract 6 weeks after taking the course and closed 3 months later."

## FAQ

[

#### What is the key difference in your course vs. all the others?

The key difference is how we approach this course vs. every other course we’ve experienced. Our Acquisitions Foundations course takes you down a specific path. Instead of dumping 15 choose-your-own-path of what to do and when to do it video hours on you, we give you play-by-play instructions so you know what, why, and how to do it. You even get templates and exercises. Then we give you the next step. That produces momentum, gives you small quick wins, and keeps you motivated and excited to keep going. All of which give you confidence and increase your chances of reaching your goal. It’s the same process we use to buy our own businesses, so we know it works (even during recessions). Another key difference is we specifically teach you how to buy the best off-market deals and use seller financing to creatively negotiate the most profitable deal possible. Other courses don’t teach this, or don’t teach it well, and expect you to use a broker (who works for the seller, not the buyer) and go into debt to buy a business (not ideal). We want you to get the best business, with the best deal, using no money of your own (or as little as possible).

#### How do I decide between buying the course and joining the Contrarian Academy?

Simple – buy the course if you only want the information and resources. Plenty of people have been able to learn the ins and outs of business acquisition and become owners from it. However, most people want more than information and resources. They want connection, accountability, and support. This is where the Contrarian Academy comes in. If you would benefit from a full year of expert guidance and accountability, weekly support calls, deal review calls, and an active and growing online community supported by expert facilitators, the Academy is where you want to be. It’s where most future business owners people end up. Buying a business (especially your first) can be long, challenging and lonely. So, if you’re fully committed to buying a business within the next 365 days, we recommend joining the Contrarian Academy. For everyone else, we recommend sticking to just the course. You can always upgrade to the Contrarian Academy when you’re ready (and we’ll credit 100% of your course purchase towards the Contrarian Academy).
