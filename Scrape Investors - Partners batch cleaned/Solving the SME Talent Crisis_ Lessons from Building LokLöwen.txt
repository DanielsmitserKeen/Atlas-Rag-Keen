_In this exclusive [SME Tech Leaders](https://www.smetechleaders.com/) Newsletter interview, we sat down with **[Artur Penkala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artur-penkala-379ba41/)**, Co-Founder & Managing Director of **[LokLöwen](https://lokloewen.de/)**, to discuss how his company is tackling one of the biggest challenges facing SMEs today: the talent shortage. LokLöwen is redefining workforce solutions for the railway industry, not just by staffing but by training, developing, and retaining skilled talent using a tech-enabled, people-first approach._

_Artur shares insights on how LokLöwen scales without external investors, the role of AI and hybrid training in workforce management, and the lessons he has learned building an SME from the ground up. With LokLöwen being an LP at **[āltitude](https://www.altitude-vc.com/)**, he also reflects on the broader trends shaping SME innovation and why backing early-stage SME tech startups is key to driving the next wave of transformation._

**You are the founder of a successful SME – what inspired you to start your company LokLöwen?**

My journey into entrepreneurship was shaped by both personal and professional experiences. My family immigrated to Germany from Poland when I was a child, arriving without speaking the language. This forced me to adapt quickly, develop resilience, and understand the value of hard work. Later, working in the railway and logistics industry, I saw firsthand how a severe talent shortage was disrupting operations.

Together with my co-founder, [Dennis Leonidis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-leonidis-5a2408167/), we identified a clear market gap: the railway industry was struggling to find and retain skilled personnel like train drivers, and traditional staffing solutions weren’t addressing the issue holistically. In 2019, we founded LokLöwen, not just as a staffing company but as a talent development and workforce solutions provider, prioritizing employee well-being, hybrid training, and technology-driven workforce management.

As Dennis has also faced certain challenges during his childhood and teenage years, we both quickly agreed that people can thrive when given the right opportunities. That’s why LokLöwen is built around a strong company culture, where we focus on personal growth, individual coaching, and long-term employee retention – something often overlooked in traditional industries.

**How do your personnel solutions differ from traditional staffing agencies, and what makes your approach unique?**

At first glance, people assume we are just another staffing firm – but LokLöwen is fundamentally different. Most agencies provide short-term personnel, with little investment in training or employee development. We train, certify, and retain our staff long-term.

We have built a hybrid training model, combining practical on-site learning with digital modules and AR/VR simulations to accelerate the learning process while maintaining high safety and operational standards. Beyond that, we act as strategic advisors to railway operators, helping them optimize personnel planning, process automation, and workforce restructuring.

As mentioned before, what clearly sets us apart is our people-first culture. LokLöwen employees receive above-market salaries, regular 1:1 coaching, and the support of a Feel Good Manager who ensures their well-being. Unlike many firms that prioritize volume and turnover, we focus on quality and long-term placements – which, in turn, ensures better retention and service reliability for our clients. We are convinced that you have to put your employees first to have happy customers.

**How do you plan to expand across Europe and beyond?**

The railway industry is highly regulated, but the talent shortage is universal. Currently, we serve Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, with many of our German-based employees operating cross-border in Austria and Switzerland. Our goal is to establish local training hubs across Germany so that more talent can be developed where demand is highest.

Expansion in Austria and Switzerland is already underway, and we are exploring strategic partnerships in the US and other European markets. However, we believe in smart growth – we are not chasing rapid expansion at the expense of quality. Instead, we prioritize markets where we can bring real value through training, tech-enabled workforce management, and industry expertise.

**The railway industry faces an unprecedented shortage of skilled workers. What are the root causes, and how is LokLöwen addressing this crisis?**

There are three key factors driving the talent crisis:

*   Aging Workforce – More train drivers and railway professionals are retiring than are being trained. Many SMEs and even national operators have no structured pipeline to replace them.
    
*   High Training Barriers – Becoming a train driver isn’t as straightforward as getting a driver’s license. It takes 12+ months of rigorous training, which discourages many potential candidates.
    
*   Lack of Awareness – Despite its stability and growth potential, the railway sector isn’t marketed well as a career path. Many people simply don’t know how to become a train driver.
    

At LokLöwen, we tackle these issues head-on. Our hybrid training makes certification more accessible, while our HR marketing efforts on TikTok and Instagram engage younger audiences. We also actively recruit individuals from non-traditional backgrounds, offering mentorship to help them transition into the industry.

**Many industries face talent shortages, but the railway sector is particularly affected. What role does technology play in training and retaining talent at LokLöwen?**

Technology is at the core of what we do. We use AI-driven workforce planning to optimize staffing for our clients and AR/VR-based training modules to enhance learning efficiency. These innovations reduce training time while maintaining the highest safety standards.

We also implement predictive analytics to assess workforce trends, allowing railway companies to anticipate staffing needs and proactively train new talent. By integrating digital HR solutions, hybrid learning models, and automated scheduling, we are modernizing an industry that has remained largely traditional for decades.

**You’ve built a strong company culture that prioritizes employee well-being and development. How do you ensure your team remains engaged and motivated?**

Our people aren’t just numbers on a schedule – they are the core of our business. At LokLöwen, we focus on:

*   Above-market salaries to attract and retain top talent.
    
*   Personalized career coaching & mentorship to foster growth.
    
*   A Feel-Good Manager who ensures employee well-being.
    
*   Direct access to leadership, including myself and my co-founder.
    

We also invest in team-building events, leadership workshops, and transparent internal communication. Employees know they are valued, which results in higher job satisfaction and lower turnover.

**Scaling a people-centric business without external investors is rare. What challenges have you faced, and how has organic growth shaped your business?**

Growing organically, without external funding, meant we had to be disciplined and strategic. The key challenges were:

*   Gaining credibility in a conservative industry.
    
*   Managing cash flow while scaling operations.
    
*   Balancing quality with demand – we never compromise on training just to grow faster.
    

By focusing on sustainable growth, we’ve built a company that doesn’t rely on external investors to survive, giving us full control over our strategic direction.

**LokLöwen is at the intersection of SME innovation and workforce solutions. What trends do you see shaping the future of SME tech and workforce management?**

The future of SME tech will be defined by:

*   AI-driven workforce management to optimize efficiency.
    
*   No-code ERP systems that allow SMEs to build custom solutions.
    
*   Hybrid training models with AR/VR for skill development.
    
*   Data-driven decision-making for operational agility.
    

At LokLöwen, we’re already adopting some of these innovations. For example, we use **[Cleverlohn](https://www.cleverlohn.de/)**, one of āltitude’s portfolio companies, to streamline our payroll management. As a company that operates in a highly regulated industry, having a digital payroll system that reduces administrative friction has been a game changer for us. It allows us to ensure accuracy, compliance, and efficiency, so we can focus on scaling the business while keeping our employee experience smooth.

SMEs that embrace automation in operational processes like payroll, workforce planning, and training will gain a significant edge – especially in traditional industries like logistics, construction, and manufacturing that are struggling with complexity and labor shortages.

**With LokLöwen, you are also an LP at āltitude. What attracted you to back a venture capital fund that invests in early-stage SME tech startups?**

As founders of an SME, Dennis and I know the struggles of scaling a company in a complex, regulated industry. We decided to invest in āltitude because we both believe the next wave of innovation will focus on digitizing old-school industries like the railway industry we operate in. Through our involvement with āltitude, we want to:

*   Support founders building real-world digital solutions for SMEs.
    
*   Mentor startups tackling workforce and logistics challenges.
    
*   Help bridge the gap between traditional industries and modern tech.
    

The network and insights from āltitude’s LP base, portfolio companies, and SME Tech Leaders community give us an unparalleled advantage in understanding SME pain points and emerging solutions.

**If you were to advise other SME founders and operators, what key lessons have you learned from scaling LokLöwen?**

1.  Put your employees first. Happy employees lead to happy clients.
    
2.  Invest in tech, but don’t forget the human factor.
    
3.  Be strategic with growth. Scaling too fast can break a business.
    

Building a great company isn’t just about revenue – it’s about creating something meaningful while focusing on your team first.
