# SaaS Metrics | Downloadable Templates

Through analysing the KPIs and metrics of (literally) thousands of SaaS businesses, we have developed a comprehensive metrics template for you to use. It only requires four data inputs to work: **your MRR per client data**, **sales and marketing costs** (or customer acquisition costs), **gross margins** and **monthly burn**. Inputting these four datasets allows you to immediately and automatically calculate several useful visualisations of your metrics, using the standardised off-the-shelf definitions.

**Among others, the core analysis includes:**

*   Overall MRR/ARR growth
*   Movements in client numbers and ARPA and underlying drivers of ARPA
*   Quick ratios
*   Core unit economics including CAC payback and LTV/CAC, magic number, as well as retention stats 
*   A full suite of cohort analysis, including cohorted gross and net retention, and cohorted gross profit vs CAC  

The template also allows you to automatically split the entire customer base into two cohorts at a time (eg self-serve vs assisted, SMB vs enterprise, Europe vs North America etc.) and allows you to see almost all the analysis described in this section that’s not related to sales and marketing costs (as cohort attribution here is tricky to unpick).

In this video, Oxx partner Phil Edmondson-Jones explains what the template can be used for, who it will be relevant for and how to input data into the template to ensure all of the charts and analyses are updated correctly.

### _How to interpret the template_

In this video, Phil takes you through each chart in the template in some detail to explain what they mean, and how to understand them.
