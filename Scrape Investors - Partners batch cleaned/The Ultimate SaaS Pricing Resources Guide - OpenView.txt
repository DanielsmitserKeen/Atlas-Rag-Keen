# The Ultimate SaaS Pricing Resources Guide

Pricing is a SaaS company’s most efficient profit lever, but it’s also one of the easiest things to screw up. Nailing your SaaS pricing strategy requires more than just picking the optimal price and forgetting about it. Pricing must be continuously monitored to ensure you’re effectively landing, expanding and retaining your customer base.

And it needs to consider both the rational and irrational sides of how people make purchase decisions.

Best practices in SaaS pricing have evolved over the years, and this updated guide is here to help you stay ahead of the curve. It includes the latest and greatest SaaS pricing resources, as well as some timeless staples. The content comes both from OpenView as well as external experts like our friends at Price Intelligently, Simon-Kucher & Partners, OnStartups and Sixteen Ventures.
